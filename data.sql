From a discussion between myself and <a href="http://mikelittle.org/">Mike Little</a> about <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">forking our favorite blogging software</a>, to powering 18% of the web. It&#8217;s been a crazy, exciting, journey, and one that won&#8217;t stop any time soon.</p>\n<p>At ten years, it&#8217;s fun to reflect on our beginnings. We launched WordPress on 27th May 2003, but that wasn&#8217;t inception. Go back far enough, and you can <a href="http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/">read a post by Michel Valdrighi</a> who, frustrated by the self-hosted blogging platforms available, decided to write his own software; &#8220;b2, a PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and GreyMatter.&#8221; b2 was easy to install, easy to configure, and easy for developers to extend. Of all the blogging platforms out there, <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2</a> was the right one for me: I could write my content and get it on the web quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, life gets in the way. In 2002, Michel stopped maintaining b2. Over time, security flaws became apparent and updates were needed and, while the b2 community could write patches and fixes, no one was driving the software forward. We were lucky that Michel decided to release b2 under the GPL; the software may have been abandoned, but we weren&#8217;t without options. A fork was always a possibility. That was where it stood in January 2003, when <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">I posted about forking b2</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/#comment-445">Mike responded</a>. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>From the very beginning to the present day, I&#8217;ve been impressed by the thought, care, and dedication that WordPress&#8217; developers have demonstrated. Each one has brought his or her unique perspective, each individual has strengthened the whole. It would be impossible to thank each of them here individually, but their achievements speak for themselves. In WordPress 1.2 the new Plugin API made it easy for developers to extend WordPress. In the same release <code>gettext()</code> internationalization opened WordPress up to every language (hat tip: <a href="http://ryan.boren.me/">Ryan Boren</a> for spending hours wrapping strings with gettext). In WordPress 1.5 our Theme system made it possible for WordPress users to quickly change their site&#8217;s design: there was huge resistance to the theme system from the wider community at the time, but can you imagine WordPress without it? Versions 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 saw improvements that let users install and update their plugins and themes with one click. WordPress has seen a redesign by <a href="http://v2.happycog.com/create/wordpress/?p=design/wordpress/">happycog</a> (2.3) and gone under extensive user testing and redesign (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/edanzico/riding-the-crazyhorse-future-generation-wordpress-presentation">Crazyhorse</a>, Liz Danzico and Jen Mylo, WordPress 2.5). In WordPress 3.0 we merged WordPress MU with WordPress &#8212; a huge job but 100% worth it. And in WordPress 3.5 we revamped the media uploader to make it easier for people to get their images, video, and media online.</p>\n<p>In sticking to our commitment to user experience, we&#8217;ve done a few things that have made us unpopular. The <a href="http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-wysiwyg-editor-is-a-disaster/">WYSIWYG editor</a> was hated by many, especially those who felt that if you have a blog you should know HTML. Some developers hated that we stuck with our code, refusing to rewrite, but it&#8217;s always been the users that matter: better a developer lose sleep than a site break for a user. Our code isn&#8217;t always beautiful, after all, when WordPress was created most of us were still learning PHP, but we try to make a flawless experience for users.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all about developers. WordPress&#8217; strength lies in the diversity of its community. From the start, we wanted a low barrier to entry and we came up with our &#8220;famous 5 minute install&#8221;. This brought on board users from varied technical background: people who didn&#8217;t write code wanted to help make WordPress better. If you couldn&#8217;t write code, it didn&#8217;t matter: you could answer a question in the support forums, write documentation, translate WordPress, or build your friends and family a WordPress website. There is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">space in the community</a> for anyone with a passion for WordPress.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been wonderful to see all of the people who have used WordPress to build their home on the internet. Early on <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/switchers/">we got excited</a> by <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/more-switchers/">switchers</a>. From a community of tinkerers we grew, as writers such as <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/05/om-malik/">Om Malik</a>, <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2004/05/15/mark-pilgrim-switches/">Mark Pilgrim</a>, and <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/07/mollycom-switches/">Molly Holzschlag</a> made the switch to WordPress. Our commitment to effortless publishing quickly paid off and has continued to do so: <strong>the WordPress 1.2 release saw 822 downloads per day, our latest release, WordPress 3.5, has seen 145,692 per day.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m continually amazed by what people have built with WordPress. I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://justintimberlake.com/main/">musicians</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/01/neil-leifer-on-wordpress/">photographers</a>, magazines such as <a href="http://life.time.com/">Life</a>, <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>, and the <a href="http://observer.com/">New York Observer</a>, <a href="http://www.compliance.gov/">government websites</a>, a <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/pressfs-a-wordpress-filesystem/">filesystem</a>, <a href="http://www.ymcanyc.org/association/pages/y-mvp"> mobile applications</a>, and even <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/2010/06/12/so-apparently-wordpress-can-guide-missiles/">seen WordPress guide missiles</a>.</p>\n<p>As the web evolves, WordPress evolves. Factors outside of our control will always influence WordPress&#8217; development: today it&#8217;s mobile devices and retina display, tomorrow it could be Google Glass or technology not yet conceived. A lot can happen in ten years! As technology changes and advances, WordPress has to change with it while remaining true to its core values: making publishing online easy for everyone. How we rise to these challenges will be what defines WordPress over the coming ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>To celebrate ten years of WordPress, we&#8217;re working on a book about our history.</strong> We&#8217;re carrying out interviews with people who have involved with the community from the very beginning, those who are still around, and those who have left. It&#8217;s a huge project, but we wanted to have something to share with you on the 10th anniversary. To learn about the very early days of WordPress, just after Mike and I forked b2 <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/history/">you can download Chapter 3 right here</a>. We&#8217;ll be releasing the rest of the book serially, so watch out as the story of the last ten years emerges.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/"> I penned my own letter to WordPress</a> and other community members have been sharing their thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://zed1.com/journalized/archives/2013/01/25/wordpress-a-10-year-journey/">Mike Little on our Ten Year Journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Core contributor Helen Hou-Sandi <a href="http://helen.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/happy-10th-wordpress-and-thanks-from-my-little-family/">wishes WordPress happy birthday</a>.</li>\n<li>Peter Westwood on <a href="http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2013/05/27/a-decade-gone-more-to-come/">a decade gone</a>.</li>\n<li>Support rep Mika Epstein <a href="http://ipstenu.org/2013/you-me-and-wp/">on her WordPress journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Dougal Campbell <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2013/05/27/instagram-my-wife-suzecampbell-and-i-celebrating-the-wordpress-10th-anniversary-with-bbq-in-our-wordpress-shirts-wp10/">celebrating with his wife, Suze</a>.</li>\n<li>Otto on <a href="http://ottodestruct.com/blog/2013/how-wp-affected-me/">how WordPress affected him</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see how WordPress&#8217; 10th Anniversary was celebrated all over the world <a href="http://wp10.wordpress.net/">by visiting the wp10 website</a>, according to Meetup we had 4,999 celebrators.</p>\n<p>To finish, I just want to say thank you to everyone: to the developers who write the code, to the designers who make WordPress sing, to the worldwide community translating WordPress into so many languages, to volunteers who answer support questions, to those who make WordPress accessible, to the systems team and the plugin and theme reviewers, to documentation writers, event organisers, evangelists, detractors, supporters and friends. Thanks to the jazzers whose music inspired us and whose names are at the heart of WordPress. Thanks to everyone who uses WordPress to power their blog or website, and to everyone who will in the future. Thanks to WordPress and its community that I&#8217;m proud to be part of.</p>\n<p>Thank you.

We are constantly moving forward. As each release cycle begins and ends (3.6 will be here soon, promise!), we always see an ebb and flow in the contributor pool. Part of ensuring the longevity of WordPress means mentoring new contributors, continually bringing new talent and fresh points of view to our family table.</p>\n<p>I am beyond pleased to announce that this summer we will be mentoring 8 interns, most of them new contributors, through <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code</a> and the <a href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/JuneSeptember">Gnome Outreach Program for Women</a>. Current contributors, who already volunteer their time working on WordPress, will provide the guidance and oversight for a variety of exciting projects  this summer. Here are the people/projects involved in the summer internships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Ryan McCue</strong>, </strong>from Australia, working on a JSON-based REST API. Mentors will be Bryan Petty and Eric Mann, with a reviewer assist from Andrew Norcross.</li>\n<li><strong>Kat Hagan</strong>, from the United States, working on a Post by Email plugin to replace the core function. Mentors will be Justin Shreve and George Stephanis, with an assist from Peter Westwood.</li>\n<li><strong>Siobhan Bamber</strong>, from Wales, working on a support (forums, training, documentation) internship. Mentors will be Mika Epstein and Hanni Ross.</li>\n<li><strong>Frederick Ding</strong>, from the United States, working on improving portability. Mentors will be Andrew Nacin and Mike Schroder.</li>\n<li><strong>Sayak Sakar</strong>, from India, working on porting WordPress for WebOS to Firefox OS. Mentor will be Eric Johnson.</li>\n<li><strong>Alex Höreth</strong>, from Germany, working on  adding WordPress native revisions to the theme and plugin code editors. Mentors will be Dominik Schilling and Aaron Campbell, with a reviewer assist from Daniel Bachhuber.</li>\n<li><strong>Mert Yazicioglu</strong>, from Turkey, working on ways to improve our community profiles at profiles.wordpress.org. Mentors will be Scott Reilly and Boone Gorges.</li>\n<li><strong>Daniele Maio</strong>, from Italy, working on a native WordPress app for Blackberry 10. Mentor will be Danilo Ercoli.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Did you notice that our summer cohort is as international as the #wp10 parties going on today? I can only think that this is a good sign.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always a difficult process to decide which projects to mentor through these programs. There are always more applicants with interesting ideas with whom we&#8217;d like to work than there are opportunities. Luckily, WordPress is a free/libre open source software project, and anyone can begin contributing at any time. Is this the year for you? We&#8217;d love for you to join us as we work toward #wp20. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif'' alt='';)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> </p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/the-next-10-starts-now/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 11 May 2013 03:44:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2584";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:374:"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3 is now available!

This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies">sponsorship information</a><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general.

If you&#8217;re a forward-thinking theme developer, you should be looking at implementing the new Post Format support in some of your themes (look to Twenty Thirteen for inspiration).</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to your feedback. If you break it (i.e. find a bug), please report it, and if you’re a developer, try to help us fix it. We&#8217;ve already had more than 150 contributors to version 3.6 — it&#8217;s not too late to join the party!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-3-6-beta-1/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:45:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WordPress 3.5.1 Maintenance and Security Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/wordpress-3-5-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/wordpress-3-5-1/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 22:23:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Security";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2531";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:363:"WordPress 3.5.1 is now available.

The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/">3.4</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited &#8220;media release&#8221; featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool. 3.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead. We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms &#8212; <a href="http://ios.wordpress.org/">iOS</a>, <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">Android</a>, <a href="http://blackberry.wordpress.org/">Blackberry</a>, <a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/">Windows Phone</a>, <a href="http://nokia.wordpress.org/">Nokia</a>, and <a href="http://webos.wordpress.org/">WebOS</a> &#8212; and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic  updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">core</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">theme review</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/support/">forum support</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/updates/">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href="http://sopastrike.com/numbers/">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn&#8217;t be a recap without counting up the <a href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans.

What other types of WordPress generators would you find useful?</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/jORrz52sRZQ" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 02:46:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"WPTavern: PressForward – RSS Reader Inside Of WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7370";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:105:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/mb-pcnNNH3w/pressforward-rss-reader-inside-of-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4412:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/PressforwardLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7371" alt="Press Forward Logo" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/PressforwardLogo.jpg?resize=419%2C72" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the impending shutdown of Google Reader on July 1st, I&#8217;ve been looking for Feedreader alternatives. I happened to stumble across a recently developed plugin called <a title="https://github.com/PressForward/pressforward" href="https://github.com/PressForward/pressforward">PressForward</a>. Developed for the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu" target="_blank">Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media</a> at <a href="http://gmu.edu" target="_blank">George Mason University</a> by <a href="http://aramzs.me" target="_blank">Aram Zucker-Scharff</a>, <a href="http://boone.gorg.es/" target="_blank">Boone B. Gorges</a>, and <a href="http://clioweb.org" target="_blank">Jeremy Boggs</a>, PressForward provides not only a set of curation tools for authors, but a simple feedreader as well. The plugin is in beta form and it&#8217;s obvious once you start using it but here is my experience with it thus far.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pressforward1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7377" alt="PressForward Interface" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pressforward1.jpg?resize=500%2C274" /></a></p>\n<p>My main interest was determining whether PressForward could work as my primary feedreader with the added benefit of being within the back-end of WordPress. After experimenting with it for the better part of the day, I&#8217;ve determined that it&#8217;s not something that fulfills my needs. For starters, there is no way to browse feeds by folder/site, it&#8217;s all or nothing. Adding feeds is another matter. It&#8217;s not as simple as clicking an RSS feed button and adding the site to the back-end of WordPress. Instead, you&#8217;ll need to link to a OPML file or provide the URL of a single feed. In the future, it would be beneficial to have the ability to upload an OPML file instead.</p>\n<h2>What And Who This Plugin Is Really Meant For:</h2>\n<p>The ideas behind this plugin start to shine when you consider its feature set mixed with a multi-author website. Say we have a website with 7 authors dedicated to all things WordPress. All 7 authors can use the feedreader in PressForward to curate content from those feeds and then nominate their content to be published to the front page. When a piece of content is nominated, it goes under review and from here, authors can automatically create a draft post from the nominated content.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pressforward3.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7378" alt="Press forward Draft" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pressforward3.jpg?resize=249%2C149" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the administrators that can curate content. PressForward has drop-down menus that control the permission levels for specific sections of the plugin. I could see this becoming handy for someone that wanted to create a crowd-sourcing site dedicated to a specific topic.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pressforward4.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7379" alt="PressForward Permission Settings" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pressforward4.jpg?resize=337%2C306" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the other neat aspects is the built-in commenting system. Each article can be commented on which aids in collaborating on the story. Those comments are not accessible to the public.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>PressForward is not a good recommendation for single site authors looking to replace their desktop or service based feedreaders with something that exists within WordPress. However, this is definitely a plugin to keep your eyes on if you&#8217;re the owner of a multi-authored website that covers specific topics and would like an easier way to collaborate with others on different stories.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/mb-pcnNNH3w" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 22:17:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"WPTavern: WordPress 3.6 Status Update";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7373";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/3Aw2itwe0Y8/wordpress-3-6-status-update";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1533:"<p>I&#8217;ve received some emails and Twitter responses asking me if I knew any information as to when WordPress 3.6 would be released.

I stopped by the WordPress developers chat today to figure out what was going on and here is what I know. There is still quite a bit of work to be done before 3.6 is officially released. When I posed the question of when could we expect either a new beta or 3.6 to be released, here was the answer I received from Andrew Nacin:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When it&#8217;s done.

At the same time, I&#8217;ve been reminded that if there are no updates on the Make.Core.WordPress site it&#8217;s because the developers are knee deep in code trying to get things fixed.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/3Aw2itwe0Y8" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 21:09:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"WordPress.tv: Billie Hillier: How to Make Readers &amp;

That is hard to believe considering it&#8217;s never been as easy to publish content online as it is today. However, whether or not WordPress is the best tool for <strong>THAT</strong> job is up for debate. There is a reason why some WordPress faithful like Jason Schuller of <a href="http://press75.com/" title="http://press75.com/">Press75.com</a> have stopped using WordPress for their personal sites and instead, have gone off to create <a href="http://dropplets.com/" title="http://dropplets.com/">their own vision</a> of what a publishing platform should be like. I asked Jason what pushed him over the edge to stop using WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not sure that any one thing in particular pushed me over the edge. Being excited, happy and passionate about what I’m working on/with is very important to me, and I no longer feel any of those things when it comes to WordPress. Creating a simple WordPress theme (for example) has become a grueling task because there are certain expectations that you have to consider in order for the WordPress community to accept your work. </p>\n<p>I still think WordPress is an amazing piece of software that has opened so many doors for so many people and that is something I will never forget&#8230; it’s just not something that interests me in its current state or direction. My focus is on creating simple/elegant solutions that actual people can use without having to spend weeks reading through tutorials or sifting through admin menus. Also, in order to continue to learn and grow as an entrepreneur I have to leave WordPress behind and find my own path.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then there is <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Manual#Introduction" title="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Manual#Introduction">Habari</a>. Habari is another project created from the ground up from former WordPress developers/users. If you want to hear Matt&#8217;s thoughts on Habari at the time, I highly encourage you to <a href="http://wp-community.org/2007/01/18/episode-18-habari-wordpress-206-released-wordpress-21-enters-beta/" title="http://wp-community.org/2007/01/18/episode-18-habari-wordpress-206-released-wordpress-21-enters-beta/">listen to episode 18 of the original WordPress Podcast</a> from January 18th, 2007 starting at the 10:34 mark. Their news bit includes a quote from Matt with his thoughts on the release of Habari as well as open-source competitors. I wonder if his attitude on competitors is the same today as it was back then. </p>\n<p>There are a handful of other publishing platforms available but the core point I want to draw attention to is that they all seem to focus around one thing. <strong>Simplicity</strong>. One of the major features of WordPress in its early years was in fact, simplicity. Now it seems as though that simplicity is disappearing and is ending up in entirely new codebases. There is no need to panic but it&#8217;s a trend worth taking note of. </p>\n<p>I love the freedoms that WordPress provides but I&#8217;d hate to see people give up those freedoms to go behind a walled garden because WordPress is just too darn complex to use. A strong pillar of the WordPress ecosystem is its third-party community via plugins and themes. But this pillar can not exist as the foundation of WordPress, nor should it. The foundation should be the publishing software.

I was happy to make the first monetary donation when the project got started, and as of last week I was able to make a closing bookend donation for the remaining amount they needed, a bit above $1.5M. It was an honor to chip in along with the thousands of other supporters who have already donated to make the project a reality.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls. &#8212; Pablo Picasso</p></blockquote>\n<p>My hope is that over the next few years, and perhaps beyond that, the lights brighten people&#8217;s experience of San Francisco whether they see them every night or they&#8217;re one of the 16 million that visit the city every year. Hopefully that effect, however small, spreads to their other interactions long after the lights are off and the sun comes up. There are countless good causes around the world, some which I support regularly <a href="http://ma.tt/about/">are listed on my about page</a>, and I hope to have the opportunity to support many more in the future, but this close-to-home gift to a city that has given me so much seemed like the right thing right now.</p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen them yet, here are the lights in action, more on the <a href="http://thebaylights.org/celebrating-solutions/">tech fixes happening to the lights on TBL</a>, and <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/02/bay-bridge-cable-walk/">photos I took climbing the bridge a few months ago</a>:</p>\n<p></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 15:09:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"WP Windows Phone 7: Version 2.2 Now Available: Gallery Support for self-hosted sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/?p=456";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/version-2-2/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3983:"<p><a href="http://wpwindowsphone.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/wpwindowsphone-2-0-gallery-support.png"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-412" alt="Version 2.2 of WordPress for Windows Phone: Gallery Support for Self-Hosted sites" src="http://wpwindowsphone.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/wpwindowsphone-2-0-gallery-support.png?w=300&h=560" width="300" height="560" /></a>Version 2.2 of WordPress for Windows Phone is now available in the Windows Phone Store. It introduces gallery support for self-hosted sites running WordPress 3.5 or higher. It also resolves many of the outstanding issues and quirks that you have mentioned on the forums and on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Galleries are a great way to share pictures with your friends and followers. An image gallery will display thumbnails for all images attached to a particular post or page. Readers can tap or click any image to launch the gallery full-screen, displaying huge versions of your images.</p>\n<p>You can create a gallery straight from your device by attaching two or more pictures to a post or a page. You can even customize the appearance of a gallery by tapping the &#8220;gallery settings&#8221; button and choosing the best options for your site.</p>\n<h3>Gallery Styles</h3>\n<p>You have great control over how the gallery will be displayed: as a thumbnail grid, or as a slideshow. Both gallery types offer a lot of options to choose, not limited to: random order, page or file attachment.</p>\n<p>Below is an example of an image gallery using the default thumbnail setting. If you click on any of the images you will be able to see what the carousel view looks like:</p>\n\n<a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/01-dashboard/" title="01-dashboard"><img /></a>\n<a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/02-write-screen/" title="02 - write screen"><img /></a>\n<a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/03-gallery-settings/" title="03- gallery settings"><img /></a>\n<a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/04-gellery-settings/" title="04 - gellery-settings"><img /></a>\n\n<p><strong>Gallery as a slideshow</strong></p>\n<a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/version-2-2/#gallery-456-1-slideshow">Click to view slideshow.</a>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><span>More improvements and bug fixes</span></h3>\n<p>This release also includes improvements for WordPress.com  push notifications, as well as fixes for crashes and other bugs.</p>\n<h3>Download</h3>\n<p>Ready to get the latest?

I came to the conclusion that they can&#8217;t which was the basis behind my WordPress news sites disappearing into the <a title="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-news-sites-and-the-bermuda-triangle" href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-news-sites-and-the-bermuda-triangle">bermuda triangle post</a>. I&#8217;ve had a chance to look at all the feedback surrounding the topic and it&#8217;s clear that some have totally missed the point I was trying to make. Some of the websites that have repeatedly been used as examples of success in this market include <a title="http://wpdaily.co/" href="http://wpdaily.co/">WPDaily.co</a>, <a title="http://www.wpbeginner.com/" href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/">WPBeginner</a>, <a title="http://www.wpcandy.com" href="http://www.wpcandy.com">WPCandy</a>, and <a title="http://wpmu.org" href="http://wpmu.org">WPMU.org</a> to name a few. The only website in that group that comes close to what I tried to achieve is WPCandy. The other sites all have a source of income that is not based on the content they are publishing.</p>\n<p><strong>WPDaily.co</strong> &#8211; This website is backed by 8Bit</p>\n<p><strong>WPBeginner</strong> &#8211; They offer services such as consulting and custom WordPress designs.</p>\n<p><strong>WPMU.org</strong> &#8211; This site is funded by a commercial plugins and themes</p>\n<p><strong>WPRealm</strong> &#8211; All of the contributors are compensated outside of the content they produce on WPRealm. </p>\n<p>Starting to notice a trend here?</p>\n<p>All four of those websites publish WordPress news and related items on a routine basis but they&#8217;re also excellent examples of the primary point I made: <em>A news centric website takes so much time and energy to maintain and keep fresh, it’s not worth it in the long run unless you have a company backing you or an auxiliary source of cash that pays the bills and puts food on the table at the same time.</em></p>\n<p>A number of people suggested I should have started a consulting section on WPTavern but that was something I was never interested in doing. I was and still am a content creation guy. I needed to figure out how to make the content I created pay for the bills while also getting to the point where the site was self-sustainable. I tried affiliate links for themes and plugins I reviewed, display advertising, sponsorships, nothing I tried was as consistent as a 40 hour work week. I did toy with the idea of putting up a paywall but I wanted as many people as possible to read what I had to say.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I believe that there is space to make money providing WordPress news and information without selling out. I also think that this notion that there would be a void had Matt Mullenweg not bailed out the Tavern and funded Jeff to write there is totally false.</p>\n<p>The WordPress ecosystem is a market like any other, and holes in markets tend to be filled. What fills a hole in a particular market may take different shape over time as the solutions evolve, but people are always out there to fill voids. Especially if you can do something to fill a void that you are passionate about. <a href="http://poststat.us/on-wordpress-news-sites/" title="http://poststat.us/on-wordpress-news-sites/">Brian Krogsgard &#8211; PostStat.us On WordPress News Sites</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>I agree with Brian that there would not have been a void had the Tavern disappeared. Once things started to go south on this website, WPCandy was rocking and rolling. I watched from the sideline as WPCandy became the coolest place to be in the WordPress community and saw Ryan Imel take ideas I had for the Tavern and turn them into reality e.g. the first print edition WordPress magazine, <a href="http://wpcandy.com/quarterly/" title="http://wpcandy.com/quarterly/">The WPCandy Quarterly</a>. Once things started to go south for WPCandy, WPDaily.co became the new popular watering hole. There is never a void in the WordPress news space. </p>\n<p>One of the few people to understand my original point is Curtis McHale. He has an <a href="https://plus.google.com/113827756965068019660/posts/EfgkNUNacea" title="https://plus.google.com/113827756965068019660/posts/EfgkNUNacea">ongoing conversation</a> taking place on Google+. At the end of his comment, he asks the following question: <em>Can a WordPress site monetize just on the news it produces? It may be a naïve assumption that it&#8217;s possible (without a ton of ads).﻿</em> A similar <a href="http://wpmu.org/wordpress-news-sites-are-they-worth-paying-for/" title="http://wpmu.org/wordpress-news-sites-are-they-worth-paying-for/">type question asked on WMPU.org</a> <em>Is WordPress news worth paying for?</em> After my experience with WPTavern, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible for a WordPress news centric site to survive solely on the content it produces. I&#8217;m interested to see if Brian proves me wrong with PostStat.us.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll close out this post by providing these words of wisdom. </p>\n<blockquote><p>My advice to anyone wanting to start a WordPress news centric website, especially if you think it’s going to make you some money is to stop immediately. Focus your efforts on where the real cash is. Commercial plugins, themes, and services. A news centric website takes so much time and energy to maintain and keep fresh, it’s not worth it in the long run unless you have a company backing you or an auxiliary source of cash that pays the bills and puts food on the table at the same time. The value and worth comes from writing code, not text.</p></blockquote>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/ROLwPSYuSzE" height="1" width="1"

Without this plugin, AudioTheme themes will not function. This setup enables the separation between code and design. The nuts and bolts behind this theme are the custom post types. There are three primary post types, <strong>Gigs, Discography, and Videos</strong>. Each one has a set of custom meta boxes like record details, or ticket prices. While the screenshot shows off a tool-tip, I would like to see more of these added. For example, when adding a new gig, there is a custom meta box for Tickets. One of the fields is for configuring a tickets URL. It&#8217;s not obvious if this URL is something within the theme or a URL to an outside source such as TicketMaster. A simple tool-tip could explain exactly what that field is for. However, most of the theme is self-explanatory.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AudioThemeVolumeControl.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7324" alt="AudioTheme Volume Slider" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AudioThemeVolumeControl.jpg?resize=303%2C159" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the coolest features within this framework is the jukebox. The source of music can come from a record or a list of tracks. Once the jukebox is set up, a media player will show up at the bottom of the browser window giving visitors the option to browse through tracks, stop/play, click to a specific point in the music timeline, and volume control. While it&#8217;s a small nitpick, I found the volume control confusing. In most media players, moving the slider<em> down to up</em> or<em> left to right</em> will increase volume. In the jukebox, moving from left to right will increase the volume but the way it&#8217;s displayed makes it look as though the volume is being lowered. A simple color switch would solve this problem.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AudioThemeJukebox.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7323" alt="AudioTheme" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AudioThemeJukebox.jpg?resize=560%2C192" /></a></p>\n<p>Both the themes and the plugin framework are licensed under the GPLv2, the same license as WordPress. While checking out, you&#8217;ll notice text that stipulates how many sites you can use the framework on. This is related to how many sites can receive support and is not a restriction of use. Because of the separation between theme and plugin, each has its own price tag. If you&#8217;re a theme developer, you&#8217;ll probably want to look at purchasing only the AudioTheme framework and design around it. But for non-coders, you&#8217;ll most likely need to buy both a theme <strong>and</strong> the framework. However, the website states that any theme purchase will come with a personal license to use the framework.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the most user-friendly setup but I like the versatility it provides them as a company. By keeping the framework separate, AudioThemes can work with other  companies to build designs around their plugin as they did with <a title="https://audiotheme.com/view/blocco/" href="https://audiotheme.com/view/blocco/">Press75</a>. I&#8217;m hoping that in the future, they have a ton of designs to choose from.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>Overall, the theme I reviewed along with the framework was not only easy to install, but easy to use as well. I remember 5-8 years ago that some of the features that come standard with the AudioTheme Framework and with WordPress were very hard to come by in any other CMS. Take the Jukebox for example. Something like the Jukebox 5-8 years ago would involve installing hacks or using some sort of third-party service. This example of utilizing custom post types has taught me why their versatility is such an exciting component of WordPress. Based on this theme and some other examples I&#8217;ve seen, when a good design is paired with custom post types, magical things happen. I can&#8217;t wait to come across indie or established artists utilizing AudioTheme to get their music to the world, without the need for a middle man.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/1aN6wZQjnf4" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:04:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"WPTavern: What’s Going On With The WordPress Importer?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7313";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/c2TvkfWm2CQ/whats-going-on-with-the-wordpress-importer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3608:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WPImporterRatings.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WPImporterRatings.jpg?resize=164%2C181" alt="WordPress Importer Ratings" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7317" /></a>A few days ago, I received an email informing me that the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/">WordPress importer</a> plugin was having issues and was at the brink of receiving as many 1 star ratings as it had 5. It&#8217;s never a good sign when you see support forum stats like this: <em>0 of 10 support threads in the last two months have been resolved</em>. But considering the topic creator has to mark the topic as resolved, this is not a fool-proof method of determining if a plugin is broken. From what I can tell, most of the issues surround partial imports and the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/does-not-import-images-file-attachements" title="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/does-not-import-images-file-attachements">importing of images</a>. </p>\n<p>I used the importer to move all the content from WPTavern.com to a local install of WordPress. I chose to do a full export/import. The WXR file was around 17 megs but WordPress seemed to take forever to process the file, even on my local machine. While all the images were imported properly, they were not attached to the proper posts. The images that were displayed on the local site were linked to the ones within the media library on WPTavern.com. After dropping all the tables from the database and starting over, I tried to import my files again with the same results. Just to see what would happen, I exported only my posts with attachments to see if both would be imported correctly. While the posts were imported correctly, none of the media attachments were brought over into the media library. As illustrated in the support forum post I linked above, the only way to move media attachments from one site to another is to export/import <strong>EVERYTHING</strong>. If I select attachments to be downloaded and exported, then that&#8217;s what should happen no matter which variety of ways I export the content. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/NoMediaAttachments.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/NoMediaAttachments.jpg?resize=328%2C240" alt="No Media Attachments" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7315" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve exported/imported content from one WordPress site to another so I don&#8217;t remember how the process is suppose to play out but if the behavior I described above is considered normal, the import process is definitely not as painless as it should be. After all, exporting/importing from WordPress to WordPress should be as easy as counting 1,2,3. Unlike other plugins that have a specific author, this one is developed by the <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/wordpressdotorg/" title="http://profiles.wordpress.org/wordpressdotorg/">WordPressdotorg</a> team so it&#8217;s not clear who to contact. </p>\n<p>If you have used the WordPress export/import plugin within the past few weeks and have also run into problems, I&#8217;d love for you to chime in on the comments. I&#8217;d especially like to hear from those that export/import sites on a routine basis. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/c2TvkfWm2CQ" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 23:51:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 1.8-beta1 is now available";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://buddypress.org/?p=165934";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://buddypress.org/2013/06/buddypress-1-8-beta1-is-now-available/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37732:"<p>Ladies and gentlemen, start your testing engines: BuddyPress 1.8-beta1 is ready for a lap around the track.</p>\n<p>If you develop BuddyPress themes or plugins, or if you run a BP-powered community site, now is the time to start testing the next major version of BuddyPress in your development environments. BP 1.8 will feature a large number of fixes and enhancements. For the full list, see <a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=1.8">the 1.8 milestone in Trac</a>. Here is a short list of major changes, areas where you may want to focus your testing energies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>BP_Group_Extension</code></strong> has been largely rewritten, with the goal of making Group Extension plugins faster and more consistent to write (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4955">#4955</a>). We&#8217;ve worked hard to make sure that existing <code>BP_Group_Extension</code> plugins will continue to work as before, but we encourage you to verify your own plugins. In the upcoming days, I&#8217;ll be writing updated Codex documentation for the Group Extension API, so you can see how the new features in BP 1.8 will make writing group extension plugins radically simpler. Watch <a href="http://bpdevel.wordpress.com">bpdevel.wordpress.com</a> for updates.</li>\n<li>The <strong>group administration panels</strong> in the Dashboard have seen some improvements &#8211; in particular, to the way that the Manage Members section works (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4482">#4482</a>, <a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4977">#4977</a>). Pagination support has been added to the member lists in these panels, as well as the <code>bp_group_has_members()</code> stack that underpins the panels.</li>\n<li>The <strong>bp-legacy stylesheet</strong> has undergone a process of &#8220;detheming&#8221; (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4953">#4953</a>). We&#8217;ve combed through the bp-legacy CSS &#8211; which provides BP-specific styling on themes that don&#8217;t have native support for BP &#8211; and removed some of the lingering stylistic remnants of the bp-default theme. Now, things like font faces, buttons, and form element styling will be inherited from your WordPress theme in a much more graceful way.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve introduced a new <strong>template hierarchy layer for top-level templates</strong> (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4639">#4639</a>). Similar to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy">WordPress&#8217;s template hierarchy</a>, this new feature allows themes to provide top-level template files that are specific to a component or item. For example, if your theme contains a template at <code>groups/index-directory.php</code>, it&#8217;ll be used instead of <code>buddypress.php</code> or <code>page.php</code> when viewing the Groups directory. See <a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/7212">r7212</a> for more details on the hierarchy, and watch the <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org">Codex</a> and <a href="http://bpdevel.wordpress.com">bpdevel</a> for documentation between now and the 1.8 release.</li>\n<li><code>bp_has_groups()</code> and <code>bp_has_activities()</code> now accept a <strong><code>meta_query</code> parameter</strong> (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3521">#3521</a>). This means you can filter a group or activity query based on groupmeta or activitymeta, using the very same <code>meta_query</code> syntax familiar from <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Custom_Field_Parameters">WP_Query</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>@-mentions can now be disabled</strong> (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3388">#3388</a>), by adding <code>add_filter( ''bp_activity_do_mentions'', ''__return_false'' );</code> to your bp-custom.php file.</li>\n<li><strong>RSS feeds for activity streams</strong> have been overhauled (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5020">#5020</a>). Our RSS implementation has been brought more in line with best practices for feed construction. And feed-building logic has been abstracted from myriad standalone feed templates into a single <code>BP_Activity_Feed</code> class, which makes the creation of custom feeds a breeze.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember that BuddyPress 1.8-beta1 is beta software, and we don&#8217;t recommend running it on a production site quite yet.</p>\n<p>Get 1.8-beta1 via svn, or by downloading <a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.1.8-beta1.zip">the zip file from wordpress.org</a>.

to best provide support for the software you create is an interesting point of deliberation. I&#8217;ve gone through various stages and iterations, all different as circumstances have evolved, but all driven by the same question:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  How can I create the best experience for the user in a way that is sustainable?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>On a podcast a while back I said something to this effect:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Free support is only sustainable on either end of the spectrum. Either you have so many users that you&#8217;re able to well monetize them to the point that you have a dedicated support team tasked with making sure they are well cared for; or you have so few users that the drain on your time is negligible and can easily be handled along with other day-to-day tasks. The tricky stuff lies in the middle.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>When I first started writing hacks for b2 and plugins and themes for WordPress, my life looked a lot different than it does now. I had a day job which paid all my bills, a wife that also worked long hours, and the work I did on my own site was what generated most of the code I released to the community.</p>\n<p>The community was also much smaller and had a different profile back then. A handful of hackers that would use each other&#8217;s code, send each other suggestions, and generally collaborate as peers.</p>\n<p>Nowdays the profile of the average WordPress user is far different. WordPress has become a tool for business users that do not need to have technical experience to make WordPress work for them. This is awesome, but it fundamentally changes the nature of the support requests I see.</p>\n<p>My station in life has changed quite a bit too. I have a daughter, I run a great team of 15 people and I&#8217;m dealing with some <a href="https://alexking.org/blog/2013/05/31/cancer">medical issues</a>. I don&#8217;t have the time that I used to, and what time I do have I&#8217;d rather spend building something than responding to emails.</p>\n<p>How I<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> handle support today is to break it down into two types of support:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>User Support</li>\n<li>Product Support</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With <strong>User Support</strong>, we provide one-on-one attention and do our best to solve whatever issues the user might be experiencing. This can even extend to troubleshooting plugin conflicts and server configuration issues. We reserve this level of support for our paid products (<a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/ramp/">RAMP</a>, <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/carrington-build/">Carrington Build</a>, etc.).</p>\n<p>For our free products, we provide <strong>Product Support</strong>. This means we listen and pay attention to bug reports and try to fix anything that appears to have a reproducible use case. However we do not provide one-on-one support for users and do not dive deeply into one-off reports of edge cases.</p>\n<p>I feel that this is a reasonable compromise, and I believe that most of the users of my products agree. There will always be people who believe they can make unreasonable demands on your time, but luckily there&#8217;s a handy button on those emails (or even voicemails, yikes!) for resolving them with minimal effort.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A few years back I had the idea that the collective support burden on WordPress plugin developers had grown to the point that we should all outsource it to a 3rd party. To support this, I created WP HelpCenter and tried to partner with plugin and theme developers through a referral program.</p>\n<p>This ended up being a flop, for a few reasons. The main on was users that actually needed support were typically unwilling to pay for it. From their perspective the plugin/theme wasn&#8217;t working and they were doing the developer a favor by reporting a bug. They certainly weren&#8217;t going to pay anything for it. What users are willing to pay for is customization, and that&#8217;s an entirely different beast.</p>\n<p>I still think something like WP HelpCenter could work, but it would be a lot of work and would need real buy-in from all parts of the community.</p>\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn:1">\n<a href="http://crowdfavorite.com">Crowd Favorite</a> uses the same approach.&#160;<a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 19:46:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"WPTavern: I’ll Be On DradCast Tonight";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7306";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/lbXLV2LPKVU/ill-be-on-dradcast-tonight";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:920:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dradcastlogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dradcastlogo.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="Dradcast Logo" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-7307" /></a> I have the pleasure of being the guest host for <a href="http://dradcast.com/" title="http://dradcast.com/">episode 16 of DradCast</a> tonight at 8PM Eastern time.

most of them are. Occasionally, I&#8217;ll come across something that is pretty interesting such as <a title="http://teslathemes.com/" href="http://teslathemes.com/">TeslaThemes</a>. TeslaThemes is a brand new theme club with the goal of producing one theme per month. In particular, I thought their <a title="http://teslathemes.com/wp-themes/coolstuff/" href="http://teslathemes.com/wp-themes/coolstuff/">Cool Stuff theme</a> introduced a unique way of displaying content via Post Formats and a timeline. After browsing around the site, I decided to get in touch with TeslaThemes to find out how they plan on surviving the WordPress theme market, especially as a theme club. <span id="more-7292"></span></p>\n<p><strong>In an ever growing crowd of companies, what do you think will set TeslaThemes apart from the competition?</strong></p>\n<p>We are aware of this very fast growing market, and especially this makes us very confident in what we do and how we do. At this moment income is not a priority, we’re mainly focused on delivering really useful themes to end-users, we do not want to create this “<em>plastic</em>”, “<em>industrial</em>”, “<em>copy paste</em>” WordPress templates as so many do. The market is over saturated with themes and templates and they all look the same. People need something unique, that can stand out of the crowd. We have a very loyal group of followers that give us the boost and confidence for what we have planned.</p>\n<div id="attachment_7294" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesPricing.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesPricing.jpg?resize=500%2C187" alt="Tesla Themes Pricing" class="size-large wp-image-7294" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">These prices will be changing soon</p></div>\n<p><strong>In your opinion, what makes a good WordPress theme?</strong></p>\n<p>Depends on who is asked. For many, they say 90% is design and 10% code, for others vice versa. We want to merge it to a golden middle, creating handcrafted design interface plus very intuitive customization process for the user, so that he enjoys personalizing his own website, without headache or paying additional developers for that. At the end of the day, when everything is done, what the rest see the design, its usability and navigation, how clean and understandable is it. For sure everyone appreciates it. No one has time to search on the page, our eyes must catch everything from a single glance. To resume, important is the design, the concept, perfect code and very intelligent and user friendly framework that will guide anyone.</p>\n<p><strong>Why have you chosen to develop commercial themes for WordPress instead of Joomla, or Drupal?</strong></p>\n<p>Frankly, we do not stop on WordPress, at this very minute we have 5 templates in the queue, where 1 is ecommerce. However, the main course is WordPress indeed. Our research shows that more and more people are opting for a simple yet complex blog or website based on WordPress, this is already both a trend and necessity. If at the beginning WordPress was meant for blogs, now it&#8217;s escalated to pretty big web applications that are using it. At TeslaThemes we can adapt any theme to any needs.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesWordPress.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesWordPress.jpg?resize=389%2C146" alt="Tesla Themes WordPress" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7295" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>What is the Tesla Framework?</strong></p>\n<p>Tesla Framework is another one of our proud products. The decision to develop it was unanimous and instant. There are many reason why, first of all we were thinking about our customers who are purchasing our Premium Templates. We’ve noticed that not very many have any technical background, the tickets we were receiving at the time were related rather to lack of technical experience and WordPress knowledge than some technical problems of the theme. At a certain point we had a huge data base of Q&#038;A and decided to build our own Framework, adapting and combining all the issues we’ve got during our daily activity. The end result, without modesty is a brilliant tool that helps anyone to customize its template in a very simple and fun way. We noticed an 85% drop for tickets, since we launched it and all the feedback we get from our customers is just great. Another strong reason to make it was the technical aspect, it increased our theme development up to 40%. Now any Tesla developer can work on any of our themes without any problem, switching whenever is needed, it is a unique platform that saves time and development costs. At the end of the day Tesla Framework was a very inspired decision both for end-users and our developers.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesFramework.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesFramework.jpg?resize=500%2C201" alt="TeslaThemes Framework" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7296" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Theme clubs are a tough way to do business. Many have come and gone. Why have you decided to go with the club route instead of charging $60-$70 per theme?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s correct, Jeff. For sure we will not go for too long with club way. The reason we have so affordable prices for single themes and annual subscription, is lack of financial priority at the moment. Of course we are not Red Cross, we also have bills and want to drive nice cars and nice vacations. All the prices for sure will go up in the next few months. Our design and development department are working now on 5 templates that must come up by middle of July, 2013. The 24/7 support we have, the handcrafted design, uniqueness, they all cost money and I am sure, people want to have really the best and they will buy our themes. </p>\n<p><strong>One of my favorite designs from TeslaThemes is the Cool Stuff theme. What was the inspiration behind the timeline display of content?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s right, Cool Stuff is one of our best sellers. It is very simple and has a modern layout. The idea behind it was very simple, inspired by flat design trend we decided to create our first flat design theme. It was rather from fun, but turned out to be a success. As a matter of fact, 4 out of 5 themes we have in the queue, are flat. The timeline display gives a faster navigation thru the page, saves user’s time and keeps a higher focus on the content. And content is king!</p>\n<div id="attachment_7297" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesTimeline.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesTimeline.jpg?resize=500%2C297" alt="Tesla Themes Timeline" class="size-large wp-image-7297" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cool way of displaying content via post formats and a timeline</p></div>\n<p><strong>Do you have any opinions on themes bundling plugins whether they are commercial or free?</strong></p>\n<p>I think that bundling plugins (whether they are commercial or free) is not good for the end user. By nature, plugins need to be detached from the framework, because in case something goes wrong the plugin can be deactivated and the user can maintain a working website without losing traffic. On the other side, bundling plugins with a theme means to compel a user to use only one plugin for a given enhancement, when the user could have used another plugin, giving the same functionality, but which the user knows better how to use.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to license the themes under the same license WordPress has? (GPL V2)</strong></p>\n<p>Because adopting this kind of license for our themes is better than writing our own, and limit what our users can do with their themes. GPL gives a sense of freedom, and clients love to hear that they have the freedom to do whatever they want with their themes after they buy it. In addition, having this license gives us some advantages, like the opportunity to promote our marketplace on WordPress.org </p>\n<p><strong>Anything you would like to say to the WordPress Community?</strong></p>\n<p>To keep up and continue to innovate. Inspiration and satisfaction. The tough market is a risk indeed but let’s see it rather as an opportunity to stand out of the crowd with great service and products. The competition develops and brings real value for everyone.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/Z4Euz_XasNc" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 22:19:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"WPTavern: Experimental Plugin Review – Inline Preview";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7284";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:103:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/IqjqafuFxhs/experimental-plugin-review-inline-preview";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2162:"<p><a title="http://www.chrisfinke.com/2013/06/11/inline-preview-plugin-for-wordpress/" href="http://www.chrisfinke.com/2013/06/11/inline-preview-plugin-for-wordpress/">Inline Preview</a> is a brand new plugin being developed by Christopher Finke. Instead of previewing posts in a new browser tab, this plugin adds an editor to the right of the post within the same tab enabling you to see what the post will look like.</p>\n<div id="attachment_7288" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/InlinePreview1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="size-full wp-image-7288" alt="Inline Preview" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/InlinePreview1.jpg?resize=500%2C375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Editor And Post In The Same Tab</p></div>\n<p>If you end up giving this plugin a try, be warned that once you click the preview button, the only way to close the inline preview area is to either reload the page or save the draft. Once I saw a screenshot of this plugin in action, I was initially excited because this is one of the features I saw in Ghost that intrigued me. However, this plugin is only at the experimental level and I&#8217;m not sure how far Chris is going to take it. But if he plans on putting more development time into it, here are a couple things on my checklist I&#8217;d like to see.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have the inline preview only show the content area of the website, no sidebar, no footer, none of the unnecessary details. Since my content area is only 600 pixels wide, it would make better use of my screen real estate.</li>\n<li>Real-time editing so that as I type or add images, I can see how those changes would look on the site.</li>\n<li>The ability to change the width of the post editor and the inline preview so that I can apply a size that works best for my monitor.</li>\n<li>An easy way to close the inline editor without having to reload the entire page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anything else you can think of that would make a plugin like this useful to you?</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/IqjqafuFxhs" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 20:31:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"WP Android: You’ve Got Notifications!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"http://android.wordpress.org/?p=847";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"http://android.wordpress.org/2013/06/11/notifications/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3864:"<p><a href="http://android.wordpress.org"><img src="http://wpandroid.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/wordpress-for-android-2-4-wordpress-com-notifications.jpg?w=242&h=491" alt="Version 2.4 of WordPress for Android: Notifications panel on a Samsung Galaxy S3" width="242" height="491" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-861" /></a>Need to get your WordPress.com or Jetpack notifications on the go?

I am a writer, blogger and internet marketer. I am from Scotland but for the last two years I have been living in South America.</p>\n<p>I first tried WordPress in 2006. During that year I had tried just about every blogging script out there. The one I chose to use for my travel blog was Serendipity. I had been using CMS&#8217;s for several years so I started looking more into using blogging platforms to create small content websites. Eventually, that led me to WordPress and I have used it ever since. <span id="more-7269"></span></p>\n<p><strong>I discovered you through BloggingTips.com. Every time I see your name, it&#8217;s behind a different blog. Are you in the business of creating and selling websites?</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/BloggingtipsLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7271" alt="BloggingTips Logo" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/BloggingtipsLogo.jpg?resize=285%2C100" /></a></p>\n<p>I have sold hundreds of websites over the years, though it is not something I always set out to do. When I sold <a title="http://www.bloggingtips.com/" href="http://www.bloggingtips.com/">BloggingTips</a> at the beginning of 2010, I had been working on it every day for 3 years. I was keen to do something else. My next blog, <a title="http://www.wphub.com" href="http://www.wphub.com">WP Mods</a>, was sold in part because of an upcoming trip throughout South America and partly to free up more time to work on other websites I was developing.</p>\n<p>To date I have over $200k worth of sales on Flippa, but I wouldn&#8217;t consider myself a website flipper. All of the websites I have sold have been developed from scratch by me.</p>\n<p><strong>I understand you make a substantial amount of your income from your work online. From your experience, which revenue generating technique has garnered the most cash?</strong></p>\n<p>I make 100% of my income online. I started working online in 2000. I was working in Finance at the time and would work on websites at night. I probably made a few hundred dollars a month, which was never enough to leave my full time job. I did make a few good sales from domains. One time in 2002 I bought a domain name at work at 8.30am and sold it at 12.00pm for around $300-$400. I had bigger sales but that was probably the most satisfying due to how quickly I turned a profit.</p>\n<p>Around 2004 I started making enough to work full time online. All of my money was coming from affiliate commissions. At the height of the gambling craze I was making over $20,000 a month. That helped pay off some debts from university and allowed some fun trips around the world.</p>\n<p>Today, I still make most of my money from affiliate referrals, adsense and banner ad sales. I am starting to make money from selling books and I earn money from freelance writing too.</p>\n<p><strong>Back in May of 2009, you and Sarah started a WordPress theme club titled appropriately enough, <a title="http://www.blogthemesclub.com/" href="http://www.blogthemesclub.com/">BlogThemesClub.com</a>. Whatever happened to the club and what valuable lessons did you learn from that experience?</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/BlogThemesClubLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7272" alt="blogthemesclub" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/BlogThemesClubLogo.jpg?resize=444%2C111" /></a></p>\n<p>haha We sold that one too :)</p>\n<p>That site developed out of BloggingTips.com. Through that site I had released several WordPress themes to the community free. We then looked into releasing premium designs to blog readers but later decided that it would be better long term to sell themes from a new domain.</p>\n<p>I am primarily a writer/marketer and Sarah is primarily a coder. Due to this, we had to outsource all the design work. This was not without its difficulties. Looking back, we probably should have brought in a designer as a partner from the start. That would have allowed us to develop themes quicker. I am sure we could have made it a success if we stuck to it though we decided to cut our losses and move on as we were spending a lot of time on it.</p>\n<p>It was a good experience and I did learn a lot from running a membership driven website and with working with a partner, so it is not something look back on with regret.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you find it difficult to generate content for your various sites or does it come natural?</strong></p>\n<p>No. That is something that I have never had a problem with. Never have, never will. I am always reading other blogs and I buy books regularly too, so I am never short of ideas. My personal blog <a title="http://www.kevinmuldoon.com" href="http://www.kevinmuldoon.com">KevinMuldoon.com</a> currently has 125 draft posts, all of which are partly written or have details of what needs to be written.</p>\n<p>The main problem is time to actually write. Over the next few months I need to greatly reduce my own writing responsibilities and bring in others to help me maintain my websites and blogs.</p>\n<p><strong>Obviously you&#8217;re only one person. What tips can you provide for those looking to hire people to write for their site?</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WPModsLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7273" alt="WPMods Logo" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WPModsLogo.jpg?resize=258%2C69" /></a></p>\n<p>Unless you want your website or blog to always remain at the same level, you need to bring people in to help you. With BloggingTips.com I had over a dozen people writing regularly. By the time I sold WPMods.com I had two or three people helping me write articles.</p>\n<p>Obviously, getting the right people is key. It can be tempting to just get the cheapest writers but you need to remember that sometimes a badly written post is worse than having no post published at all. At the start it can be a balancing act trying to keep writing costs down and turn a profit, but long term it is worth it. Generally speaking, I would rather spend money on hiring good writers than spending money on an advertising campaign or some SEO service.</p>\n<p>As you rightly point out, there is only one of me, so for me to move on and do other things, I need to hire other people. There is no other way round it. The old idiom &#8220;<strong>hire people smarter than you</strong>&#8221; definitely runs true, and once they know what you are looking for, you should feel comfortable letting them get on with their job. Spending too much time micro-managing them can be counter-productive.</p>\n<p><strong>What is it about WordPress that has you using it for just about every site you create?</strong></p>\n<p>Possibility.</p>\n<p>No other platform out there, blogging or otherwise, comes even close to offering the same level of customization that WordPress does. Can you think of any other platform that offers thousands and thousands of free and premium plugins and themes?</p>\n<p><strong>What is your biggest pet peeve with WordPress?</strong></p>\n<p>I would say it is that every plugin developer out there wants to hijack my admin area and place a large menu link on my admin sidebar. There are plugins that only take two minutes to set up and then you never need to configure them again, yet they hog my sidebar. All major plugin developers, including Automattic, seem to be doing this.</p>\n<p>I am aware that there are plugins out there that let me remove links from the main menu and put them somewhere else, however I do not feel that WordPress users should need to do this. Why should we have to go to the hassle of cleaning up their mess?</p>\n<p><strong>Where would you like to see WordPress 5 years from now?</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/wordpresslogo.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/wordpresslogo.png?resize=150%2C150" alt="wordpresslogo" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-422" /></a></p>\n<p>I like the fact that WordPress has started removing things like blogrolls and adding them back as plugins. The core version should not be too bloated.</p>\n<p>The problem is that there is so much functionality lacking from the core that you end up installing lots of plugins, thereby slowing down your site. Take commenting for example, WordPress blogs suffer from spam so badly that you need to install Akismet right off the bat. Then you need to install at least one additional plugin to reduce spam, whether it be to add a CAPTCHA field or trick bots into thinking they have completed all fields.</p>\n<p>Many people have turned to third-party commenting systems to address this, though they are not always ideal either. So, like many people, I have started using Jetpack for my comments. It works great, but using that plugin means that I a need to install many other things that I do not want installed.</p>\n<p>The same thing can be said about security. I have had a few of my blogs infected with malware over the last year so I now install security plugins on every WordPress website I own. It would be better if WordPress tackled this problem head on and make the product more secure. I understand that WordPress is always going to be targeted more than other platforms due to its popularity, though when it comes to the point of needing to install anti-spam and anti-malware plugins every time they use WordPress, you need to step back and think about whether the core product needs to be upgraded.</p>\n<p>Today, I have over a dozen plugins that I install on every website. I review the plugins I have installed regularly, though a quick check on my personal blog shows that I have 37 activated plugins. Many of these plugins address problems with other plugins or problems with the core. For example, I have&nbsp;Manual Control for Jetpack to stop the Jetpack plugin automatically enabling new modules they add and I have&nbsp;WP Missed Schedule installed to stop WordPress not publishing my articles on time (and never sending me an email to notify me of this).</p>\n<p>Last but not least, I think that WordPress is starting to look dated in some respects. Without doubt it is functional, but along the way it has lost its style. I use the WordPress iOS app regularly and it works great, however accessing WordPress through my browser seems clunky at times.</p>\n<p>WordPress has become the number one content management system in the world, though I think there is a danger of it losing its title as the best blogging platform. New blog platforms such as SquareSpace and Ghost are simplifying the whole process of blogging and allowing people to focus more on content instead of worrying about spam, viruses and configuring cache plugins.</p>\n<p>Competition is good and I hope that WordPress can take the best features of these new platforms and integrate it into their own platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Anything you&#8217;d like to say to the entire WordPress community?</strong></p>\n<p>I would encourage people to support plugin and theme developers where they can; whether it be telling others of their good work, making a donation or upgrading to their premium products. That being said, I also think WordPress users are allowed to be critical, even of those who release products for free. As a content producer, I understand why many developers get touchy about criticism, though it is essential to their products, and WordPress as a whole, getting better.</p>\n<p>So be supportive and be critical about something if you need to be, though make sure you are polite and professional when you do so. Those who complain for the sake of complaining deserve to be ignored :)</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/BHMHzDo53Fg" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 16:48:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"WPTavern: Recap Of WordCamp Milwaukee 2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7264";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/JbJHpoCeOY4/recap-of-wordcamp-milwaukee-2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:850:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WordCampMilwaukee2013Logo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WordCampMilwaukee2013Logo.jpg?resize=216%2C108" alt="WordCamp Milwaukee 2013 Logo" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7265" /></a>This past weekend, WordCamp Milwaukee 2013 took place.

There were at least two themes hosted on the ThemeForest marketplace that were bundling commercial WooThemes plugins along with a copy of GravityForms. Those themes have been <a title="http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/bundling-premium-gpl-plugins-on-themeforest-themes/100141" href="http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/bundling-premium-gpl-plugins-on-themeforest-themes/100141">temporarily hidden from view by ThemeForest</a> until they comply with revised guidelines. This is a great article filled with a number of great points but the comments are just as good.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s Just A Bad Idea</strong> &#8211; Bundling plugins with themes is already a bad practice but when those plugins have a commercial nature to them and need API access keys to work properly, it becomes an incredibly bad idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Support Nightmare</strong> &#8211; I love the infinite loop for support described by Coen so much, I&#8217;m just going to paste it here as it clearly illustrates how bad it can be for users to get support.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The author of the plugin is WooThemes. “They should help me, right?”</li>\n<li>Wrong, they can’t help you. You haven’t purchased the plugin from WooThemes, so they can’t support you. This is not just because you haven’t purchased it from them, but they also have no way of knowing what’s been done with the code. This makes it virtually impossible to support the code.</li>\n<li>The WooThemes support crew will probably tell you to ask the theme author.</li>\n<li>The theme author has no real ways of supporting the plugins they bundle with the theme, simply because they didn’t write the plugin.</li>\n<li>The initial response of the theme author is often to contact the author of the plugin. Resume these steps at #1, infinite loop!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>GPL</strong> &#8211; People are still confused when they see a theme or plugin licensed under the <a title="http://wordpress.org/about/gpl/" href="http://wordpress.org/about/gpl/">GPL</a> and then see licenses that specify the number of websites the plugin can be used on. Being licensed under the GPLv2 means the code is freely available and can be modified or redistributed. During the checkout process, if the word <em>restrict</em> is in the description it generates <em>red flags</em>. It&#8217;s important to note that most commercial GPL theme/plugin licenses deal strictly with how many sites will be supported by them based on which support license you buy. In some instances such as GravityForms, you&#8217;re not only purchasing a support license, but also an API access key that provides access to updates and other functionality. The API aspects of GravityForms have nothing to do with GPL. As <a title="http://coenjacobs.me/en/dont-buy-bundled-premium-plugins/#comment-9401" href="http://coenjacobs.me/en/dont-buy-bundled-premium-plugins/#comment-9401">Carl Hancock points out</a>, look at Akismet, VaultPress, or WordPress.com as good examples of plugins that are GPL but the features they offer are through an API/service which is not accessible because it&#8217;s a software as a service model.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that redistributing any themes or plugins licensed under the GPL commercial or not for free or for a price is completely within the confines of the license as long as proper attribution is maintained and the copyright notice is left in tact. What the two themes on ThemeForest were doing was not illegal.</p>\n<p><strong>Abuse Of The Unlimited Sites License</strong> &#8211; This is an interesting one. Using GravityForms as an example, if you buy the unlimited sites option, you&#8217;ll have support for unlimited sites, support multi-site, have unlimited forms, unlimited entries, 1 year of updates, etc. <a title="http://coenjacobs.me/en/dont-buy-bundled-premium-plugins/#comment-9296" href="http://coenjacobs.me/en/dont-buy-bundled-premium-plugins/#comment-9296">According to Simone</a>, team leader of Your Inspiration Themes, they had purchased a Developer License granting them the ability to install GravityForms on an unlimited amount of sites. They were bundling GravityForms with their themes but in order for customers to receive upgrades, they would push out a new theme update which included the newest version of GravityForms.</p>\n<p>I have to give Simone credit for coming up with a somewhat creative way of being able to offer GForms updates without their theme customers needing to have an individual access key. However, because of how GravityForms works, they have the ability to turn off keys if they discover they  are used in such a way that <a title="http://www.gravityforms.com/terms-and-conditions/" href="http://www.gravityforms.com/terms-and-conditions/">violates their TOS</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Not Getting What You Paid For</strong> &#8211; According to Simone, by bundling plugins like GForms in their themes, they are offering value. In reality, the are offering headaches. The following paragraph in Simone&#8217;s response is important to take note of.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Keep in mind that we are not re-selling the plugins and above all we don’t provide key licenses to our customers. When an update of those plugins is released, we will as soon as possible release a new theme update with the new version of the plugin. We know how important is to keep updated the WordPress installation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When customers buy their themes, they&#8217;re not actually buying the plugins that are bundled with them. If that&#8217;s the case, why bother bundling the plugins at all? The only conclusion I can come to is that they are ripping off GravityForms and others while providing so called value to their customers.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>I hope YIT and ThemeForest have both learned their lesson in this ordeal. ThemeForest needs to tighten up its theme reviewing process. YIT needs to remove the commercial plugins until they can strike a unique reseller deal with both GForms and WooThemes. Since Simone claims their themes sold well without having any plugins, I hope they remove them because the overall practice of bundling plugins with themes is stupid.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/0ZyY80tRsrU" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 16:11:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WordPress.tv: Brian Casel: Building Your Niche Freelance Business With WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=19665";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/06/09/brian-casel-building-your-niche-freelance-business-with-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:710:"<div id="v-feHnr6Fp-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/19665/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/19665/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=19665&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/06/09/brian-casel-building-your-niche-freelance-business-with-wordpress/"><img alt="Brian Casel: Building Your Niche Freelance Business With WordPress" src="http://videos.videopress.com/feHnr6Fp/video-85c225c8b6_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 09 Jun 2013 13:26:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"WordPress.tv: Michael McKinnon: Hackers Ahoy!

Unfortunately, the plugin I used in the past was no longer available but it&#8217;s how I found that out that was the interesting thing. While the plugin was listed, the description said the plugin was empty and no long available. Just for giggles, I tried to install the plugin and nothing happened. Upon looking at the <a href="http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/431935/delete-post-revisions" title="http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/431935/delete-post-revisions">Trac changes for the plugin</a>, the last thing the plugin author did was delete all the files. After getting in touch with Otto about the plugin showing up in search results, he removed it but told me it wasn&#8217;t the proper way to go about closing a plugin down. So what is the proper way?</p>\n<h2>How To Orphan A Plugin:</h2>\n<p>Plugin authors have the ability to not only add other authors to the commit team but also hand over the entire plugin to someone else. Removing all the code related to the plugin is frowned upon because someone else could use that code either as a fork or the foundation for a similar type of plugin. But if you really want to have your plugin removed from the repository, sending an email to plugins@wordpress.org with your request should do the trick. If a plugin author decides to orphan a plugin that I&#8217;m using, I would really appreciate it if in the last update, somewhere within the readme or change log it stated that it would be the last version released and that it would no longer be supported. This would give ample opportunity for me to look at alternative plugins. </p>\n<h2>Adopting A Plugin:</h2>\n<p>There currently is no official way to adopt someone&#8217;s plugin. There has been some discussion in the past about creating an orphaned plugin program but those ideas never materialized. One of the reasons why the program never saw the light of day is because there were so few people wanting to adopt a plugin. Otto recommends trying to contact the author, and if that fails, email the plugins team plugins@wordpress.org. Show that you have code changes already made, as a good will thing, because what we don&#8217;t want is somebody taking over a plugin and making just superficial changes while putting their own name on it, sort of thing. So the plugins team verifies the code, tries to contact the original author, wait a reasonable time, etc. </p>\n<h2>WP Recycle:</h2>\n<p>There used to be a third party site that dealt exclusively with abandoned plugins called <a href="http://www.noupe.com/wordpress/wp-recycle-fresh-perpectives-for-starving-wordpress-plugins-73451.html" title="http://www.noupe.com/wordpress/wp-recycle-fresh-perpectives-for-starving-wordpress-plugins-73451.html">WPRecycle</a>. It was an offshoot of Pluginchief.com but it looks like the website has since gone offline. I&#8217;m going to try to get in touch with those behind WPRecycle to figure out why the program failed or why the site has gone offline. </p>\n<p>While researching for this post, I came across <a href="http://digwp.com/2012/10/abandoned-plugin-adoption-program/" title="http://digwp.com/2012/10/abandoned-plugin-adoption-program/">an article</a> published by Matt Jones on the Digwp website. Even though it was a pitch for the WPRecycle program, he <a href="http://digwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/infographic-abandoned-wp-plugins.jpg" title="http://digwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/infographic-abandoned-wp-plugins.jpg">came up with a stat that</a> showed 1/3 of the plugin repository at that time had the 2 year update warning. I wonder what those numbers are like today with 25,369 plugins in the repository.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that a plugin update can occur with no code changes taking place. If only a readme file of a plugin was changed this would count as an update and would reset the 2 year warning. </p>\n<h2>Just What Is Abandonment?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to talk about plugin abandonment because there are no hard set rules that dictate when a plugin is officially abandoned. This was one of the biggest problems the core team faced when they discussed the requirements needed for a plugin to reach this status. A plugin with good code that doesn&#8217;t need to be updated for extended periods of time could be considered abandoned even though it wouldn&#8217;t be. </p>\n<p>Do you think orphaned plugins is a growing concern or is there a natural process in place that prevents this from ever becoming a serious problem? I would only consider it a serious problem if we reach a statistic where 50% or more of the plugins in the repository are abandoned. However, what if the total amount of plugins in the repository is 50,000 and 50% of those are dead? That still leaves us with 25,000 active plugins. What would the numbers have to be for a tipping point of users not finding the extensibility that has helped make WordPress as popular as it is today?</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s continue this conversation in the comments. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/GXyv4sYRk-s" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 07 Jun 2013 13:26:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 04:28:46 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"189465";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 04:15:28 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130501105914";}', 'no');

Now you might think that&#8217;s not very news worthy, but it was his first post since February 25th. Up until that time he had been a very regular blogger, consistently writing posts with the occasional brilliant one between them. And that&#8217;s where the problem lay, as he discloses in his post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Truth is, sometimes, even someone as outspoken as me just doesn’t have anything really all that pertinent to write about on a blog like this one, and though the discipline to carry on writing “content” day after day anyway is admirable in many ways, I found the exercise pretty much mired in futility.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I know how that feels. I write tutorial type posts all the time, as I do a lot of actual WordPress work and have inspiration for them, but I don&#8217;t write about SEO as often as I used to. The reason is simple: I&#8217;d be writing &#8220;content&#8221;. I&#8217;d be writing for the sake of writing. I&#8217;d be writing because I have loads of readers that want to read and it makes me feel good. To quote Olivier once more, because it&#8217;s too good of a quote to not repeat a 1000 times:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You want to feel important, go do something important, something that actually matters &#8230;.. Do <em>something</em>. But for fuck’s sake, stop filling empty space with “content.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I like the idea of content marketing (though I hate the term <em>almost</em> as much as I hate the term &#8220;inbound marketing&#8221;, but that&#8217;s another story). But that type of marketing only works when you have an <em>actual</em> story to tell. Not made up bullshit. A real story with real life experiences and insights. To have those real life experiences, you have to do <em>work</em>. No-one can just &#8220;content market&#8221; his way through life.</p>\n<p>So, before you start blogging about SEO, <em>do</em> some real SEO first. Make sure you <em>know</em> what you&#8217;re writing about. It&#8217;d really help a lot if people in SEO (and basically every other aspect of online marketing) would <em></em>practice <em>before</em> they preached. About 95% of the blog posts I see now copy ideas from 5 other sites and call it content. Or they&#8217;ll ask 5 UK SEO&#8217;s for an opinion about X, because they&#8217;re too bloody lazy and/or ignorant to do any real research themselves and call it &#8220;Practical Tips for Modern SEO From the Best Minds in Europe&#8221;<a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/seo-experts-from-europe-tips"></a>. I hate this new &#8220;one question interview&#8221; type of post. Do some fucking work and add some beef, or do a <em>real</em> interview (and learn to separate a country from a continent).</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the real challenge of content marketing: to tell a story about you or your product that resonates with me, provides me with value <em>and</em> makes me want to become your customer. To be able to tell that story, you or your product should have solved more than a few people&#8217;s problems first. You can content market all day long, when the product you sell is shit, it won&#8217;t help you much will it? You have to <em>work on that product</em>.</p>\n<p>In SEO, the real experts are the people who can honestly say: this worked, that didn&#8217;t. Matt said X, but Y was the truth. I tried this, and burned a site, I tried that and the site dropped. Now I&#8217;m not saying you should burn your clients sites, but I <em>am</em> saying, instead of writing 5 or 10 crappy blog posts, do some research for yourself, write some code. Try something new, and then write a <em>real</em> good blog post. In fact, I&#8217;d rather read about 10 of your failings then about that one &#8220;success&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Olivier probably ran into this issue.

Now you might think that&#8217;s not very news worthy, but it was his first post since February 25th. Up until that time he had been a very regular blogger, consistently writing posts with the occasional brilliant one between them. And that&#8217;s where the problem lay, as he discloses in his post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Truth is, sometimes, even someone as outspoken as me just doesn’t have anything really all that pertinent to write about on a blog like this one, and though the discipline to carry on writing “content” day after day anyway is admirable in many ways, I found the exercise pretty much mired in futility.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I know how that feels. I write tutorial type posts all the time, as I do a lot of actual WordPress work and have inspiration for them, but I don&#8217;t write about SEO as often as I used to. The reason is simple: I&#8217;d be writing &#8220;content&#8221;. I&#8217;d be writing for the sake of writing. I&#8217;d be writing because I have loads of readers that want to read and it makes me feel good. To quote Olivier once more, because it&#8217;s too good of a quote to not repeat a 1000 times:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You want to feel important, go do something important, something that actually matters &#8230;.. Do <em>something</em>. But for fuck’s sake, stop filling empty space with “content.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I like the idea of content marketing (though I hate the term <em>almost</em> as much as I hate the term &#8220;inbound marketing&#8221;, but that&#8217;s another story). But that type of marketing only works when you have an <em>actual</em> story to tell. Not made up bullshit. A real story with real life experiences and insights. To have those real life experiences, you have to do <em>work</em>. No-one can just &#8220;content market&#8221; his way through life.</p>\n<p>So, before you start blogging about SEO, <em>do</em> some real SEO first. Make sure you <em>know</em> what you&#8217;re writing about. It&#8217;d really help a lot if people in SEO (and basically every other aspect of online marketing) would <em></em>practice <em>before</em> they preached. About 95% of the blog posts I see now copy ideas from 5 other sites and call it content. Or they&#8217;ll ask 5 UK SEO&#8217;s for an opinion about X, because they&#8217;re too bloody lazy and/or ignorant to do any real research themselves and call it &#8220;Practical Tips for Modern SEO From the Best Minds in Europe&#8221;<a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/seo-experts-from-europe-tips"></a>. I hate this new &#8220;one question interview&#8221; type of post. Do some fucking work and add some beef, or do a <em>real</em> interview (and learn to separate a country from a continent).</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the real challenge of content marketing: to tell a story about you or your product that resonates with me, provides me with value <em>and</em> makes me want to become your customer. To be able to tell that story, you or your product should have solved more than a few people&#8217;s problems first. You can content market all day long, when the product you sell is shit, it won&#8217;t help you much will it? You have to <em>work on that product</em>.</p>\n<p>In SEO, the real experts are the people who can honestly say: this worked, that didn&#8217;t. Matt said X, but Y was the truth. I tried this, and burned a site, I tried that and the site dropped. Now I&#8217;m not saying you should burn your clients sites, but I <em>am</em> saying, instead of writing 5 or 10 crappy blog posts, do some research for yourself, write some code. Try something new, and then write a <em>real</em> good blog post. In fact, I&#8217;d rather read about 10 of your failings then about that one &#8220;success&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Olivier probably ran into this issue. You can&#8217;t keep hitting repeat and rewrite that same story all the time without getting burned out. You have to do real work and then, when all is well, every once in a while you&#8217;ll have inspiration for a really good post, you&#8217;ll have a new idea.</p>\n<p>If you do have that new idea, write that post and please do <a href="http://twitter.com/yoast">share it with me on Twitter</a>, but, please, spare me your &#8220;content&#8221;.</p>\n<p><a href="http://yoast.com/challenge-content-marketing/">You can&#8217;t content-market your way through life</a> is a post by <a rel="author" href="http://yoast.com/author/joost/">Joost de Valk</a> on <a href="http://yoast.com">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>. \n\nA good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don''t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

So, in true Yoast style, I wrote a script and decided to write this article that outlines exactly how and why to use it.</p>\n<h2>Why should I cloak my affiliate links?</h2>\n<p>If you search online for it, there are tons of reasons for people to redirect their affiliate links. The &#8220;historical&#8221; reason for cloaking affiliate links is hiding that you&#8217;re an affiliate for the search engines. Now I&#8217;m not one to think the search engines are stupid enough to be fooled by an easy script like the one I&#8217;m providing below, but there are more reasons. The funny thing is that it&#8217;s called cloaking affiliate links because of that history, but I digress. Let me give you the three reasons why I do it and why I think every affiliate should be cloaking their affiliate links:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Ease of management</strong><br />\nYou sometimes have to change your affiliate links. If you have to change them in more than one place, it&#8217;s bound to be a painful exercise, so you want to centralize management.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Prevent leaking PageRank to advertisers</strong><br />\nWhile sometimes you might want to &#8220;hide&#8221; for a search engine that you&#8217;re an affiliate, for  me the reasoning is actually the other way around. Affiliate links are ads, and those <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=96569">should be nofollowed</a> or otherwise prevented from leaking PageRank to the advertiser. Instead of nofollowing each and every link, which is painful and you&#8217;re bound to forget at some point, why not make sure search engines can&#8217;t follow the link at all?</li>\n<li><strong>&#8220;Clean&#8221; links</strong><br />\nIt might be obvious when you&#8217;re linking to Amazon that the link points to Amazon, but when I link to say, Genesis, using my affiliate link, the link would point to shareasale.com, which in turn would redirect to Genesis. So the URL of the link would be ugly and wouldn&#8217;t tell you where you&#8217;re going to. Instead, my &#8220;clean&#8221;, cloaked version of that affiliate link reads:http://yoast.com/out/genesis/That is a lot more telling about the destination isn&#8217;t it? I think it&#8217;s more user friendly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Cloaking affiliate links, the how to</h2>\n<p>The basic process of cloaking affiliate links is simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a folder from where you&#8217;ll serve your redirects, I use <em>/out/</em>.</li>\n<li>Block the <em>/out/</em> folder in your domains <em>robots.txt</em> file by adding:\n<pre>Disallow: /out/</pre>\n</li>\n<li>Use a script in your redirect folder to redirect to your affiliate URLs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Step 2 makes sure search engines won&#8217;t follow the redirects, but we&#8217;ll add some extra safety with our script. Step 3 could be as easy as writing each redirect in your redirect directory&#8217;s <em>.htaccess</em> file manually. I personally prefer something that&#8217;s a bit easier to manage, which is why I&#8217;m giving you a little redirect script I wrote below. As a bonus, this should be easier to get working on NGINX too.</p>\n<h2>Affiliate link redirect script</h2>\n<p>This script consists of three parts. The <em>index.php</em> file is the file that handles the actual redirects, it does a 302 redirect and sends an <a href="http://yoast.com/x-robots-tag-play/">X-Robots-Tag header</a> along, which makes sure the search engines that obey those headers aren&#8217;t allowed to index or follow the URL, should you forget the robots.txt exclusion.</p>\n<p>The <em>redirects.txt</em> file is a comma separated file with a very simple format:</p>\n<p>name,destination-url</p>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<p>yoast,http://yoast.com</p>\n<p>It should always have the first line:</p>\n<p>default,http://example.com</p>\n<p>Where you can change example.com to your domain. This will make sure that people who try to redirect to non-existing redirects get redirected to your homepage.</p>\n<p>If you install these two files, the script will already work. With the above setup, going to /out/?id=yoast on your server would redirect you to http://yoast.com.</p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m a bit of a URL freak and I actually like my URLs even cleaner than that, so there&#8217;s a bit of <em>.htaccess</em> involved as well. It&#8217;s only 5 lines and basically makes sure that you can link to /out/yoast and that would redirect you as well. This has the added bonus of preventing people from opening your redirects.txt file, so they can&#8217;t check out all your redirects.</p>\n<p>Neat huh?

VPS.net is fast, affordable, provides good support, and I continue to recommend them.</p>\n<p>But there are features of Synthesis that I realized I could no longer live without.</p>\n<h2>Optimized WordPress Performance</h2>\n<p>First, I don&#8217;t want to do my own Linux optimization anymore. Now I won&#8217;t have to.</p>\n<p>The Synthesis team developed its Linux server stack specifically to handle high traffic loads on WordPress websites. They have spent the last several years tweaking and perfecting this setup to provide the outstanding performance, reliability, and security that Synthesis does today.</p>\n<p>Simply put, the Synthesis team knows WordPress and they know server performance. I wanted to align with a team that understands WordPress performance better than I do. Now I have.</p>\n<h2>Theme Support</h2>\n<p>The second reason for the switch is that Synthesis, as part of Copyblogger, can simultaneously support my hosting <em>and </em>my theme.</p>\n<p>Yoast.com runs on the Genesis Framework, developed by Copyblogger&#8217;s <a href="http://yoast.com/out/studiopress/" target="_blank">StudioPress</a> design team. Yes, I could host Yoast.com anywhere and still have access to StudioPress support, but no other hosting platform is specifically tuned for Genesis. This further optimizes performance and security, and it makes updates a breeze.</p>\n<p>Plus, the Synthesis support staff is proactive about troubleshooting and quickly fixing issues specific to Genesis. A support question that might have taken two or three tickets to answer previously now will take just one because of the Synthesis/Genesis integration.</p>\n<h2>Cutting Edge Value</h2>\n<p>Copyblogger Media hosts its own business websites on regular plans from Synthesis. Beyond performance, Synthesis was designed to support the operational needs of the site owner versus that of the hosting company, and thus provides a few features that are unique among hosting providers.</p>\n<h3><strong>Operations</strong></h3>\n<p>First, Synthesis provides their customers with an uptime checker called <a href="http://yoast.com/out/site-sensor/" target="_blank">Site Sensor</a>.</p>\n<p>Beyond normal uptime checks, it can actually perform WordPress-specific checks which ensure RSS feeds and sitemaps are current. A website with broken SEO and content distribution mechanics might as well be down. The sitemap checker even supports the indexed sitemaps produced by our own <a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/" target="_blank">WordPress SEO</a> plugin, I worked with the Synthesis team to add that functionality.</p>\n<p>Second, Synthesis has backups down to a science.</p>\n<p>Synthesis already backs up my server on a nightly basis and ships it across the U.S. to a second data center. They also make local WordPress-specific backups that make it easy for their support staff to replace plugins, WP options settings, and more at a moment&#8217;s notice. Beyond this, they provide a database snapshot tool that I can use to back up my database before plugin and WP upgrades.</p>\n<p>Additionally, they are soon releasing a feature called Personal Backups for S3 that will allow me to send a backup to my own S3 bucket at Amazon. Unlike normal backup plugins, this service is actually driven by robust server-side processes and is not dependent on PHP.</p>\n<h3><strong>Site Speed</strong></h3>\n<p>Finally, I switched to Synthesis because I trust their technical aptitude and respect their forward-thinking mindset.</p>\n<p>For example, some of you may have heard about <a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper" target="_blank">SPDY</a>, Google&#8217;s initiative to speed up the web by improving HTTP and TCP. I certainly have, and it is a feature I wanted implemented on our HTTPS forums and checkout pages.</p>\n<p>With this move to Synthesis, I&#8217;ll have it.</p>\n<p>SPDY requires server-side and browser support. (For a list of compatible web browsers, <a href="http://caniuse.com/spdy" target="_blank">click here</a>.) Synthesis is one of the first WordPress-only hosts to offer SPDY compatibility for qualified sites, having already <a href="http://yoast.com/out/synthesis-spdy/" target="_blank">tested it on a few of their own most valuable properties</a>.</p>\n<p>This is just the latest example of Synthesis consistently evolving to provide more value for its customers&#8217; hosting dollar.</p>\n<h2>A True Partner</h2>\n<p>In Synthesis, I don&#8217;t see a hosting provider. I see a hosting partner. This is what I needed as Yoast.com continues to grow and evolve.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll now have more time to spend doing what I love &#8212; writing plugins, reviewing websites, even <a href="http://yoast.com/on-focus-and-how-were-slowly-changing-our-business-model/" target="_blank">writing Genesis child themes</a> &#8212; while the Synthesis team will make sure that the site is up and ready to take advantage of the next development in WordPress hosting.</p>\n<p><a href="http://yoast.com/synthesis-managed-wordpress-hosting/">Why I Switched to Copyblogger&#8217;s Synthesis Managed WordPress Hosting</a> is a post by <a rel="author" href="http://yoast.com/author/joost/">Joost de Valk</a> on <a href="http://yoast.com">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>. \n\nA good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don''t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

VPS.net is fast, affordable, provides good support, and I continue to recommend them.</p>\n<p>But there are features of Synthesis that I realized I could no longer live without.</p>\n<h2>Optimized WordPress Performance</h2>\n<p>First, I don&#8217;t want to do my own Linux optimization anymore. Now I won&#8217;t have to.</p>\n<p>The Synthesis team developed its Linux server stack specifically to handle high traffic loads on WordPress websites. They have spent the last several years tweaking and perfecting this setup to provide the outstanding performance, reliability, and security that Synthesis does today.</p>\n<p>Simply put, the Synthesis team knows WordPress and they know server performance. I wanted to align with a team that understands WordPress performance better than I do. Now I have.</p>\n<h2>Theme Support</h2>\n<p>The second reason for the switch is that Synthesis, as part of Copyblogger, can simultaneously support my hosting <em>and </em>my theme.</p>\n<p>Yoast.com runs on the Genesis Framework, developed by Copyblogger&#8217;s <a href="http://yoast.com/out/studiopress/" target="_blank">StudioPress</a> design team. Yes, I could host Yoast.com anywhere and still have access to StudioPress support, but no other hosting platform is specifically tuned for Genesis. This further optimizes performance and security, and it makes updates a breeze.</p>\n<p>Plus, the Synthesis support staff is proactive about troubleshooting and quickly fixing issues specific to Genesis. A support question that might have taken two or three tickets to answer previously now will take just one because of the Synthesis/Genesis integration.</p>\n<h2>Cutting Edge Value</h2>\n<p>Copyblogger Media hosts its own business websites on regular plans from Synthesis. Beyond performance, Synthesis was designed to support the operational needs of the site owner versus that of the hosting company, and thus provides a few features that are unique among hosting providers.</p>\n<h3><strong>Operations</strong></h3>\n<p>First, Synthesis provides their customers with an uptime checker called <a href="http://yoast.com/out/site-sensor/" target="_blank">Site Sensor</a>.</p>\n<p>Beyond normal uptime checks, it can actually perform WordPress-specific checks which ensure RSS feeds and sitemaps are current. A website with broken SEO and content distribution mechanics might as well be down. The sitemap checker even supports the indexed sitemaps produced by our own <a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/" target="_blank">WordPress SEO</a> plugin, I worked with the Synthesis team to add that functionality.</p>\n<p>Second, Synthesis has backups down to a science.</p>\n<p>Synthesis already backs up my server on a nightly basis and ships it across the U.S. to a second data center. They also make local WordPress-specific backups that make it easy for their support staff to replace plugins, WP options settings, and more at a moment&#8217;s notice. Beyond this, they provide a database snapshot tool that I can use to back up my database before plugin and WP upgrades.</p>\n<p>Additionally, they are soon releasing a feature called Personal Backups for S3 that will allow me to send a backup to my own S3 bucket at Amazon. Unlike normal backup plugins, this service is actually driven by robust server-side processes and is not dependent on PHP.</p>\n<h3><strong>Site Speed</strong></h3>\n<p>Finally, I switched to Synthesis because I trust their technical aptitude and respect their forward-thinking mindset.</p>\n<p>For example, some of you may have heard about <a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper" target="_blank">SPDY</a>, Google&#8217;s initiative to speed up the web by improving HTTP and TCP. I certainly have, and it is a feature I wanted implemented on our HTTPS forums and checkout pages.</p>\n<p>With this move to Synthesis, I&#8217;ll have it.</p>\n<p>SPDY requires server-side and browser support. (For a list of compatible web browsers, <a href="http://caniuse.com/spdy" target="_blank">click here</a>.) Synthesis is one of the first WordPress-only hosts to offer SPDY compatibility for qualified sites, having already <a href="http://yoast.com/out/synthesis-spdy/" target="_blank">tested it on a few of their own most valuable properties</a>.</p>\n<p>This is just the latest example of Synthesis consistently evolving to provide more value for its customers&#8217; hosting dollar.</p>\n<h2>A True Partner</h2>\n<p>In Synthesis, I don&#8217;t see a hosting provider. I see a hosting partner. This is what I needed as Yoast.com continues to grow and evolve.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll now have more time to spend doing what I love &#8212; writing plugins, reviewing websites, even <a href="http://yoast.com/on-focus-and-how-were-slowly-changing-our-business-model/" target="_blank">writing Genesis child themes</a> &#8212; while the Synthesis team will make sure that the site is up and ready to take advantage of the next development in WordPress hosting.</p>\n<p><a href="http://yoast.com/synthesis-managed-wordpress-hosting/">Why I Switched to Copyblogger&#8217;s Synthesis Managed WordPress Hosting</a> is a post by <a rel="author" href="http://yoast.com/author/joost/">Joost de Valk</a> on <a href="http://yoast.com">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>. \n\nA good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don''t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

Turns out the client didn&#8217;t handle scheduled downtime correctly, causing problems with Google. While this article covers some rather basic technical SEO the <a href="#varnish">last bit</a> might be interesting for more advanced users. The message from Google Webmaster Tools read like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Over the last 24 hours, Googlebot encountered 41 errors while attempting to access your robots.txt. To ensure that we didn&#8217;t crawl any pages listed in that file, we postponed our crawl. Your site&#8217;s overall robots.txt error rate is 7.0%</p></blockquote>\n<h2>HTTP status codes and search engines</h2>\n<p>A search engine constantly verifies whether content it&#8217;s linking to stille exist and hasn&#8217;t changed.  It verifies two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>is the content still being served with the correct HTTP status code (HTTP 200);</li>\n<li>is it still the same content.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An HTTP 200 status code means: all is well, here is the content you asked for. It is the <em>only </em>correct status code for content. If content has moved, you can redirect it, either permanently, with an HTTP 301 header, or temporarily, with an HTTP 302 or 307 header.</p>\n<p>If your server gives <em>any</em> other HTTP status header, it means the search engine can no longer find the content. If you server gives a 200 HTTP status code, but the page is in fact an error and says something like &#8220;File not found&#8221; or has very little content, Google will classify it as a <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=181708">soft 404</a> in Google Webmaster Tools.</p>\n<p>There is only one proper way of telling the search engine that you&#8217;re doing site maintenance:</p>\n<h2>How server downtime works for search engines</h2>\n<p>If, during a crawl, a search engine finds that some content no longer exists, ie. it gives a 404 HTTP status, it will usually remove that content from the search results until it can come back and verify that it&#8217;s there again. If this happens often, it&#8217;ll take longer and longer for the content to come back in the search results.</p>\n<p>What you should be doing is giving a 503 HTTP status code. This is the definition of the 503 status code from <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">the RFC that defines these status codes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. If known, the length of the delay MAY be indicated in a Retry-After header. If no Retry-After is given, the client SHOULD handle the response as it would for a 500 response.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, you have to send a 503 status code <em>in combination with</em> a Retry-After header. Basically you&#8217;re saying: hang on, we&#8217;re doing some maintenance, please come back in X minutes. That sounds a lot better than what a 404 error says: &#8220;Not Found&#8221;. A 404 literally means that the server can&#8217;t find anything to return for the URL that was given.</p>\n<h2>How do I send a 503 header?</h2>\n<p>In PHP the code for a 503 would be like this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">$protocol = &quot;HTTP/1.0&quot;;\nif ( &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot; == $_SERVER[&quot;SERVER_PROTOCOL&quot;] )\n  $protocol = &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;;\nheader( &quot;$protocol 503 Service Unavailable&quot;, true, 503 );\nheader( &quot;Retry-After: 3600&quot; );</pre>\n<p>The delay time, 3600 in the above example, is given in seconds, so 3600 corresponds to 60 minutes. You can also specify the exact time when the visitor should come back, by sending a GMT date instead of the number of seconds. This would result in something like this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">header( &quot;Retry-After: Fri, 19 Mar 2013 12:00:00 GMT&quot; );</pre>\n<p>Use that with caution though, setting it to a wrong date might give unexpected results!</p>\n<h2>Our site is never down, we&#8217;re on WordPress</h2>\n<p>Nonsense. Every time you upgrade your core WordPress install, or when you&#8217;re updating plugins, WordPress will give a maintenance page. The default page sends out a proper 503 header.

Turns out the client didn&#8217;t handle scheduled downtime correctly, causing problems with Google. While this article covers some rather basic technical SEO the <a href="#varnish">last bit</a> might be interesting for more advanced users. The message from Google Webmaster Tools read like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Over the last 24 hours, Googlebot encountered 41 errors while attempting to access your robots.txt. To ensure that we didn&#8217;t crawl any pages listed in that file, we postponed our crawl. Your site&#8217;s overall robots.txt error rate is 7.0%</p></blockquote>\n<h2>HTTP status codes and search engines</h2>\n<p>A search engine constantly verifies whether content it&#8217;s linking to stille exist and hasn&#8217;t changed.  It verifies two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>is the content still being served with the correct HTTP status code (HTTP 200);</li>\n<li>is it still the same content.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An HTTP 200 status code means: all is well, here is the content you asked for. It is the <em>only </em>correct status code for content. If content has moved, you can redirect it, either permanently, with an HTTP 301 header, or temporarily, with an HTTP 302 or 307 header.</p>\n<p>If your server gives <em>any</em> other HTTP status header, it means the search engine can no longer find the content. If you server gives a 200 HTTP status code, but the page is in fact an error and says something like &#8220;File not found&#8221; or has very little content, Google will classify it as a <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=181708">soft 404</a> in Google Webmaster Tools.</p>\n<p>There is only one proper way of telling the search engine that you&#8217;re doing site maintenance:</p>\n<h2>How server downtime works for search engines</h2>\n<p>If, during a crawl, a search engine finds that some content no longer exists, ie. it gives a 404 HTTP status, it will usually remove that content from the search results until it can come back and verify that it&#8217;s there again. If this happens often, it&#8217;ll take longer and longer for the content to come back in the search results.</p>\n<p>What you should be doing is giving a 503 HTTP status code. This is the definition of the 503 status code from <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">the RFC that defines these status codes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. If known, the length of the delay MAY be indicated in a Retry-After header. If no Retry-After is given, the client SHOULD handle the response as it would for a 500 response.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, you have to send a 503 status code <em>in combination with</em> a Retry-After header. Basically you&#8217;re saying: hang on, we&#8217;re doing some maintenance, please come back in X minutes. That sounds a lot better than what a 404 error says: &#8220;Not Found&#8221;. A 404 literally means that the server can&#8217;t find anything to return for the URL that was given.</p>\n<h2>How do I send a 503 header?</h2>\n<p>In PHP the code for a 503 would be like this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">$protocol = &quot;HTTP/1.0&quot;;\nif ( &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot; == $_SERVER[&quot;SERVER_PROTOCOL&quot;] )\n  $protocol = &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;;\nheader( &quot;$protocol 503 Service Unavailable&quot;, true, 503 );\nheader( &quot;Retry-After: 3600&quot; );</pre>\n<p>The delay time, 3600 in the above example, is given in seconds, so 3600 corresponds to 60 minutes. You can also specify the exact time when the visitor should come back, by sending a GMT date instead of the number of seconds. This would result in something like this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">header( &quot;Retry-After: Fri, 19 Mar 2013 12:00:00 GMT&quot; );</pre>\n<p>Use that with caution though, setting it to a wrong date might give unexpected results!</p>\n<h2>Our site is never down, we&#8217;re on WordPress</h2>\n<p>Nonsense. Every time you upgrade your core WordPress install, or when you&#8217;re updating plugins, WordPress will give a maintenance page. The default page sends out a proper 503 header. You can replace the default error page with a <em>maintenance.php</em> file in your <em>wp-content</em> folder, but if you do, you <em>have</em> to make sure that file sends out the proper 503 headers too. You can copy the code from the <a href="http://queryposts.com/function/wp_maintenance/"><code>wp_maintenance()</code></a> function.</p>\n<p>If your database is down, WordPress actually sends an internal server error, using the <a href="http://queryposts.com/function/dead_db/"><code>dead_db()</code></a> function. If you&#8217;re doing planned maintenance on your database, therefore, you&#8217;ll need to set up a custom database error message page, <em>db-error.php</em> in your <em>wp-content</em> folder that sends a proper 503 header.</p>\n<h2 id="varnish">Beware caches!</h2>\n<p>So where did our client go wrong?</p>\n<p>Funnily enough, our client <em>had</em> properly configured 503 headers on their server.

As Bill Slawski pointed out in the comments, Paul has written articles on SEO <a href="http://boagworld.com/marketing/i-dont-get-seo/">before</a>. Paul, whom I respect tremendously for his web development work, obviously doesn&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; SEO and has evidently had some bad experiences with the snake oil side of our trade over the years. Luckily he&#8217;s shown himself to be willing to learn and I hope to be part of that learning experience. But I also wanted to write about this as I think it&#8217;s important for our industry.</p>\n<p>His main argument, after you remove the link-bait title and the weird introduction, is that what <em>we</em> SEO&#8217;s call SEO these days, shouldn&#8217;t be called SEO as it should be called (decent) web development. I agree in large part with that statement. But here&#8217;s the kicker: if a web developer or web development agency fails (and they do, very often, very miserably), the client often doesn&#8217;t notice. The web developer often delivers a shiny new website with all the bells and whistles that the management asked about. The fact that technically, information structurally and architecturally, the entire site is a mess, will not be noticed by 99% of clients. At least&#8230;</p>\n<p>Not until they notice their analytics, or rather, the fact that their phone stops ringing. And they notice one specific thing: a big hole in their traffic, where organic traffic from search engines used to be. That&#8217;s when they call an SEO, because those are the people that know about search engines, right? That, Paul, is why we&#8217;re still called SEO&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a demand driven thing: the client wants more search traffic, so he / she searches for someone that delivers that to them. They don&#8217;t know that their web developer did a lousy job, it&#8217;s <em>our</em> job to tell that to them.</p>\n<p>In our <a href="http://yoast.com/hire-us/website-review/">website reviews</a> we encounter, on a daily basis, websites that have been redesigned where the web developer / designer deemed it &#8220;not necessary&#8221; to do 301 redirects from the old URL structure to the new one. Where development environments are left open for Google to index and a few wrong links in the content mistakenly go <em>to</em> that development environment, causing havoc for the website in question. Websites where a fancy new faceted based search system causes 4.5 <em>billion</em> URLs (actual example), to be created and Google slowly indexes all of them, leaving the websites ranking in dust. I can go on for hours.</p>\n<p>My buddy <a href="http://theuws.com">Richard</a> commented:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But what if they call it “inbound marketing”?</p></blockquote>\n<p>To which Paul said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I much prefer that. It does not apply that sites should be optimised for search engines over users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sigh. First of all, if SEO means anything, it&#8217;s that we optimize the search engine, not the site. The term is a weird acronym, but people know it now, so we stick with it. You see, even when BMW wants to sell &#8220;mobility&#8221;, in the end they sell cars. We all <em>want</em> to sell website optimization, but in the end, people come to us for SEO. That we&#8217;ll give them website optimization as a result doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>\n<p>Also in the comments, <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/about-seo-by-the-sea/">Bill Slawski</a> said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A person who uses things like keyword density and gateway pages is not an SEO, and never has been.</p>\n<p>But, if you need help with hreflang, canonical link elements, parameter handling, rel prev and next values for pagination, XML sitemaps for pages and images and videos and news, Google Plus authorship markup, Facebook’s Open Graph meta data, schema.org implementation, and many other issues that great content alone will not solve, an SEO can help you with those.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To his credit, Paul <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/11/seo-the-inconvenient-truth/#comment-985658">responded</a> to that thanking Bill and stating that these:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; are not things I would expect any half decent web designers to do as part of their job.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well to be honest Paul, I do expect a decent web designer to know that stuff and if he doesn&#8217;t, I expect him, and thus you, to stop commenting about SEO until you <em>do</em> know about that stuff. You obviously don&#8217;t, because If I take your article from 2010, linked above, as an example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>you haven&#8217;t implemented <a href="http://yoast.com/push-rel-author-head/">rel=&#8221;author&#8221;</a>;</li>\n<li>I can&#8217;t find an XML sitemap;</li>\n<li>most of the pages on his site except for singular posts and pages lack a decent <a href="http://yoast.com/canonical-url-links/">rel=&#8221;canonical&#8221; link element</a>;</li>\n<li>there is no <a href="http://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/">rel=&#8221;prev&#8221; / rel=&#8221;next&#8221;</a> implementation on his archives;</li>\n<li>in fact, there is no decent pagination on those archives at all, and lastly;</li>\n<li>there is no schema.org markup.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I could go on. So, Paul, you say in your article that SEO should be decent web development, but you obviously haven&#8217;t kept up to date with what decent web development is then. I have an easy fix for you though. If you install my (100% free as in beer) <a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/">WordPress SEO plugin</a> and take 2 minutes to configure it, 1 through 4 will be taken care of for you by that plugin, automatically. But if you do that I will take that as an acceptance that there is a very <em>convenient</em> truth about SEO. I trust I&#8217;ll get to convince you that SEO is worth while, but I think the world deserves more than just a comment on your post as a counter argument to your headline, which I know you now regret.</p>\n<p>Let this be the first step in me, and others, convincing you of the value in SEO. I very much hope to see an article from your hand in 6 to 12 months time stating you were wrong.</p>\n<p><a href="http://yoast.com/seo-paul-boag/">Want SEOs to lose their job?

That we&#8217;ll give them website optimization as a result doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>\n<p>Also in the comments, <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/about-seo-by-the-sea/">Bill Slawski</a> said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A person who uses things like keyword density and gateway pages is not an SEO, and never has been.</p>\n<p>But, if you need help with hreflang, canonical link elements, parameter handling, rel prev and next values for pagination, XML sitemaps for pages and images and videos and news, Google Plus authorship markup, Facebook’s Open Graph meta data, schema.org implementation, and many other issues that great content alone will not solve, an SEO can help you with those.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To his credit, Paul <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/11/seo-the-inconvenient-truth/#comment-985658">responded</a> to that thanking Bill and stating that these:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; are not things I would expect any half decent web designers to do as part of their job.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well to be honest Paul, I do expect a decent web designer to know that stuff and if he doesn&#8217;t, I expect him, and thus you, to stop commenting about SEO until you <em>do</em> know about that stuff. You obviously don&#8217;t, because If I take your article from 2010, linked above, as an example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>you haven&#8217;t implemented <a href="http://yoast.com/push-rel-author-head/">rel=&#8221;author&#8221;</a>;</li>\n<li>I can&#8217;t find an XML sitemap;</li>\n<li>most of the pages on his site except for singular posts and pages lack a decent <a href="http://yoast.com/canonical-url-links/">rel=&#8221;canonical&#8221; link element</a>;</li>\n<li>there is no <a href="http://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/">rel=&#8221;prev&#8221; / rel=&#8221;next&#8221;</a> implementation on his archives;</li>\n<li>in fact, there is no decent pagination on those archives at all, and lastly;</li>\n<li>there is no schema.org markup.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I could go on. So, Paul, you say in your article that SEO should be decent web development, but you obviously haven&#8217;t kept up to date with what decent web development is then. I have an easy fix for you though. If you install my (100% free as in beer) <a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/">WordPress SEO plugin</a> and take 2 minutes to configure it, 1 through 4 will be taken care of for you by that plugin, automatically. But if you do that I will take that as an acceptance that there is a very <em>convenient</em> truth about SEO. I trust I&#8217;ll get to convince you that SEO is worth while, but I think the world deserves more than just a comment on your post as a counter argument to your headline, which I know you now regret.</p>\n<p>Let this be the first step in me, and others, convincing you of the value in SEO. I very much hope to see an article from your hand in 6 to 12 months time stating you were wrong.</p>\n<p><a href="http://yoast.com/seo-paul-boag/">Want SEOs to lose their job?

I&#8217;ve always said and will continue to say that affiliate links should be redirected through a redirect script, but when we tried to help a client by linking to a proper explanation and example script, we couldn&#8217;t find one. So, in true Yoast style, I wrote a script and decided to write this article that outlines exactly how and why to use it.</p>\n<h2>Why should I cloak my affiliate links?</h2>\n<p>If you search online for it, there are tons of reasons for people to redirect their affiliate links. The &#8220;historical&#8221; reason for cloaking affiliate links is hiding that you&#8217;re an affiliate for the search engines. Now I&#8217;m not one to think the search engines are stupid enough to be fooled by an easy script like the one I&#8217;m providing below, but there are more reasons. The funny thing is that it&#8217;s called cloaking affiliate links because of that history, but I digress. Let me give you the three reasons why I do it and why I think every affiliate should be cloaking their affiliate links:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Ease of management</strong><br />\nYou sometimes have to change your affiliate links. If you have to change them in more than one place, it&#8217;s bound to be a painful exercise, so you want to centralize management.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Prevent leaking PageRank to advertisers</strong><br />\nWhile sometimes you might want to &#8220;hide&#8221; for a search engine that you&#8217;re an affiliate, for  me the reasoning is actually the other way around. Affiliate links are ads, and those <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=96569">should be nofollowed</a> or otherwise prevented from leaking PageRank to the advertiser. Instead of nofollowing each and every link, which is painful and you&#8217;re bound to forget at some point, why not make sure search engines can&#8217;t follow the link at all?</li>\n<li><strong>&#8220;Clean&#8221; links</strong><br />\nIt might be obvious when you&#8217;re linking to Amazon that the link points to Amazon, but when I link to say, Genesis, using my affiliate link, the link would point to shareasale.com, which in turn would redirect to Genesis. So the URL of the link would be ugly and wouldn&#8217;t tell you where you&#8217;re going to. Instead, my &#8220;clean&#8221;, cloaked version of that affiliate link reads:http://yoast.com/out/genesis/That is a lot more telling about the destination isn&#8217;t it? I think it&#8217;s more user friendly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Cloaking affiliate links, the how to</h2>\n<p>The basic process of cloaking affiliate links is simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a folder from where you&#8217;ll serve your redirects, I use <em>/out/</em>.</li>\n<li>Block the <em>/out/</em> folder in your domains <em>robots.txt</em> file by adding:\n<pre>Disallow: /out/</pre>\n</li>\n<li>Use a script in your redirect folder to redirect to your affiliate URLs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Step 2 makes sure search engines won&#8217;t follow the redirects, but we&#8217;ll add some extra safety with our script. Step 3 could be as easy as writing each redirect in your redirect directory&#8217;s <em>.htaccess</em> file manually. I personally prefer something that&#8217;s a bit easier to manage, which is why I&#8217;m giving you a little redirect script I wrote below. As a bonus, this should be easier to get working on NGINX too.</p>\n<h2>Affiliate link redirect script</h2>\n<p>This script consists of three parts. The <em>index.php</em> file is the file that handles the actual redirects, it does a 302 redirect and sends an <a href="http://yoast.com/x-robots-tag-play/">X-Robots-Tag header</a> along, which makes sure the search engines that obey those headers aren&#8217;t allowed to index or follow the URL, should you forget the robots.txt exclusion.</p>\n<p>The <em>redirects.txt</em> file is a comma separated file with a very simple format:</p>\n<p>name,destination-url</p>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<p>yoast,http://yoast.com</p>\n<p>It should always have the first line:</p>\n<p>default,http://example.com</p>\n<p>Where you can change example.com to your domain. This will make sure that people who try to redirect to non-existing redirects get redirected to your homepage.</p>\n<p>If you install these two files, the script will already work. With the above setup, going to /out/?id=yoast on your server would redirect you to http://yoast.com.</p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m a bit of a URL freak and I actually like my URLs even cleaner than that, so there&#8217;s a bit of <em>.htaccess</em> involved as well. It&#8217;s only 5 lines and basically makes sure that you can link to /out/yoast and that would redirect you as well.

I&#8217;ve always said and will continue to say that affiliate links should be redirected through a redirect script, but when we tried to help a client by linking to a proper explanation and example script, we couldn&#8217;t find one. So, in true Yoast style, I wrote a script and decided to write this article that outlines exactly how and why to use it.</p>\n<h2>Why should I cloak my affiliate links?</h2>\n<p>If you search online for it, there are tons of reasons for people to redirect their affiliate links. The &#8220;historical&#8221; reason for cloaking affiliate links is hiding that you&#8217;re an affiliate for the search engines. Now I&#8217;m not one to think the search engines are stupid enough to be fooled by an easy script like the one I&#8217;m providing below, but there are more reasons. The funny thing is that it&#8217;s called cloaking affiliate links because of that history, but I digress. Let me give you the three reasons why I do it and why I think every affiliate should be cloaking their affiliate links:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Ease of management</strong><br />\nYou sometimes have to change your affiliate links. If you have to change them in more than one place, it&#8217;s bound to be a painful exercise, so you want to centralize management.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Prevent leaking PageRank to advertisers</strong><br />\nWhile sometimes you might want to &#8220;hide&#8221; for a search engine that you&#8217;re an affiliate, for  me the reasoning is actually the other way around. Affiliate links are ads, and those <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=96569">should be nofollowed</a> or otherwise prevented from leaking PageRank to the advertiser. Instead of nofollowing each and every link, which is painful and you&#8217;re bound to forget at some point, why not make sure search engines can&#8217;t follow the link at all?</li>\n<li><strong>&#8220;Clean&#8221; links</strong><br />\nIt might be obvious when you&#8217;re linking to Amazon that the link points to Amazon, but when I link to say, Genesis, using my affiliate link, the link would point to shareasale.com, which in turn would redirect to Genesis. So the URL of the link would be ugly and wouldn&#8217;t tell you where you&#8217;re going to. Instead, my &#8220;clean&#8221;, cloaked version of that affiliate link reads:http://yoast.com/out/genesis/That is a lot more telling about the destination isn&#8217;t it? I think it&#8217;s more user friendly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Cloaking affiliate links, the how to</h2>\n<p>The basic process of cloaking affiliate links is simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a folder from where you&#8217;ll serve your redirects, I use <em>/out/</em>.</li>\n<li>Block the <em>/out/</em> folder in your domains <em>robots.txt</em> file by adding:\n<pre>Disallow: /out/</pre>\n</li>\n<li>Use a script in your redirect folder to redirect to your affiliate URLs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Step 2 makes sure search engines won&#8217;t follow the redirects, but we&#8217;ll add some extra safety with our script. Step 3 could be as easy as writing each redirect in your redirect directory&#8217;s <em>.htaccess</em> file manually. I personally prefer something that&#8217;s a bit easier to manage, which is why I&#8217;m giving you a little redirect script I wrote below. As a bonus, this should be easier to get working on NGINX too.</p>\n<h2>Affiliate link redirect script</h2>\n<p>This script consists of three parts. The <em>index.php</em> file is the file that handles the actual redirects, it does a 302 redirect and sends an <a href="http://yoast.com/x-robots-tag-play/">X-Robots-Tag header</a> along, which makes sure the search engines that obey those headers aren&#8217;t allowed to index or follow the URL, should you forget the robots.txt exclusion.</p>\n<p>The <em>redirects.txt</em> file is a comma separated file with a very simple format:</p>\n<p>name,destination-url</p>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<p>yoast,http://yoast.com</p>\n<p>It should always have the first line:</p>\n<p>default,http://example.com</p>\n<p>Where you can change example.com to your domain. This will make sure that people who try to redirect to non-existing redirects get redirected to your homepage.</p>\n<p>If you install these two files, the script will already work. With the above setup, going to /out/?id=yoast on your server would redirect you to http://yoast.com.</p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m a bit of a URL freak and I actually like my URLs even cleaner than that, so there&#8217;s a bit of <em>.htaccess</em> involved as well. It&#8217;s only 5 lines and basically makes sure that you can link to /out/yoast and that would redirect you as well. This has the added bonus of preventing people from opening your redirects.txt file, so they can&#8217;t check out all your redirects.</p>\n<p>Neat huh?

Luckily I&#8217;ve got a lot of good friends in the industry who can pick up where I&#8217;m leaving in a great way and with more time and enthusiasm than I can at this point.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll keep some room in my agenda for 3 &#8211; 4 consulting clients a year, those will be reserved for major online publishers specifically as that&#8217;s where I feel I can make a difference <em>and</em> learn a lot at the same time (<a href="https://yoast.com/hire-us/seo-consulting-services/">you can apply here</a>, though there&#8217;s only 1 spot left for this year). People that approach me for other work I&#8217;ll start saying no to and, if possible, refer them to industry friends.</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s next?</h2>\n<p>With that behind me, I&#8217;ve got more time to focus on our existing site review and premium plugin business and on new products. We&#8217;ve got more cool stuff lined up: two more premium add-ons to WordPress SEO are slowly being specced and developed and we&#8217;re also going to go in a &#8220;new&#8221; direction, by releasing our first child-theme in a month or two. It&#8217;s going to be aimed at a very specific market and I&#8217;m very curious how it&#8217;ll pan out. It&#8217;ll be a <a href="http://yoast.com/wp-theme/genesis/">Genesis</a> child-theme, because I don&#8217;t really see a need to develop a new framework when there&#8217;s something as good as that out there already and I love working with the Copyblogger family.</p>\n<p>The direction is clear though: we develop products aimed at SME&#8217;s, publishers and their SEO / online marketing agencies to help them build &amp; optimize their websites.</p>\n<p><a href="http://yoast.com/on-focus-and-how-were-slowly-changing-our-business-model/">On focus, and how we&#8217;re slowly changing our business model</a> is a post by <a rel="author" href="http://yoast.com/author/joost/">Joost de Valk</a> on <a href="http://yoast.com">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>. \n\nA good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don''t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

Turns out the client didn&#8217;t handle scheduled downtime correctly, causing problems with Google. While this article covers some rather basic technical SEO the <a href="#varnish">last bit</a> might be interesting for more advanced users. The message from Google Webmaster Tools read like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Over the last 24 hours, Googlebot encountered 41 errors while attempting to access your robots.txt. To ensure that we didn&#8217;t crawl any pages listed in that file, we postponed our crawl. Your site&#8217;s overall robots.txt error rate is 7.0%</p></blockquote>\n<h2>HTTP status codes and search engines</h2>\n<p>A search engine constantly verifies whether content it&#8217;s linking to stille exist and hasn&#8217;t changed.  It verifies two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>is the content still being served with the correct HTTP status code (HTTP 200);</li>\n<li>is it still the same content.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An HTTP 200 status code means: all is well, here is the content you asked for. It is the <em>only </em>correct status code for content. If content has moved, you can redirect it, either permanently, with an HTTP 301 header, or temporarily, with an HTTP 302 or 307 header.</p>\n<p>If your server gives <em>any</em> other HTTP status header, it means the search engine can no longer find the content. If you server gives a 200 HTTP status code, but the page is in fact an error and says something like &#8220;File not found&#8221; or has very little content, Google will classify it as a <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=181708">soft 404</a> in Google Webmaster Tools.</p>\n<p>There is only one proper way of telling the search engine that you&#8217;re doing site maintenance:</p>\n<h2>How server downtime works for search engines</h2>\n<p>If, during a crawl, a search engine finds that some content no longer exists, ie. it gives a 404 HTTP status, it will usually remove that content from the search results until it can come back and verify that it&#8217;s there again. If this happens often, it&#8217;ll take longer and longer for the content to come back in the search results.</p>\n<p>What you should be doing is giving a 503 HTTP status code. This is the definition of the 503 status code from <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">the RFC that defines these status codes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. If known, the length of the delay MAY be indicated in a Retry-After header. If no Retry-After is given, the client SHOULD handle the response as it would for a 500 response.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, you have to send a 503 status code <em>in combination with</em> a Retry-After header. Basically you&#8217;re saying: hang on, we&#8217;re doing some maintenance, please come back in X minutes. That sounds a lot better than what a 404 error says: &#8220;Not Found&#8221;. A 404 literally means that the server can&#8217;t find anything to return for the URL that was given.</p>\n<h2>How do I send a 503 header?</h2>\n<p>In PHP the code for a 503 would be like this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">$protocol = &quot;HTTP/1.0&quot;;\nif ( &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot; == $_SERVER[&quot;SERVER_PROTOCOL&quot;] )\n  $protocol = &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;;\nheader( &quot;$protocol 503 Service Unavailable&quot;, true, 503 );\nheader( &quot;Retry-After: 3600&quot; );</pre>\n<p>The delay time, 3600 in the above example, is given in seconds, so 3600 corresponds to 60 minutes. You can also specify the exact time when the visitor should come back, by sending a GMT date instead of the number of seconds. This would result in something like this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">header( &quot;Retry-After: Fri, 19 Mar 2013 12:00:00 GMT&quot; );</pre>\n<p>Use that with caution though, setting it to a wrong date might give unexpected results!</p>\n<h2>Our site is never down, we&#8217;re on WordPress</h2>\n<p>Nonsense. Every time you upgrade your core WordPress install, or when you&#8217;re updating plugins, WordPress will give a maintenance page. The default page sends out a proper 503 header. You can replace the default error page with a <em>maintenance.php</em> file in your <em>wp-content</em> folder, but if you do, you <em>have</em> to make sure that file sends out the proper 503 headers too. You can copy the code from the <a href="http://queryposts.com/function/wp_maintenance/"><code>wp_maintenance()</code></a> function.</p>\n<p>If your database is down, WordPress actually sends an internal server error, using the <a href="http://queryposts.com/function/dead_db/"><code>dead_db()</code></a> function. If you&#8217;re doing planned maintenance on your database, therefore, you&#8217;ll need to set up a custom database error message page, <em>db-error.php</em> in your <em>wp-content</em> folder that sends a proper 503 header.</p>\n<h2 id="varnish">Beware caches!</h2>\n<p>So where did our client go wrong?</p>\n<p>Funnily enough, our client <em>had</em> properly configured 503 headers on their server. There was an issue though: they use a <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish cache</a> and that Varnish didn&#8217;t transfer the 503 status code correctly, it replaced it with a &#8220;general&#8221; HTTP 500 status, causing Google to send out that error email. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to test whether that is default Varnish behavior or something they broke, but it&#8217;s worth testing for your environment.</p>\n<h2>Pro tip: sending a 503 for your robots.txt</h2>\n<p>Per <a href="https://plus.google.com/+PierreFar/posts/Gas8vjZ5fmB">this post</a> from Pierre Far of Google, if you send an HTTP 503 status code for your robots.txt, Google will halt all the crawling on your domain until it&#8217;s allowed to crawl the robots.txt again. This is actually a very useful way of preventing load on your server when doing maintenance. It still requires you to send a 503 for <em>every</em> URL on your server, including all static ones, but after Google has re-fetched the robots.txt it&#8217;ll probably stop hammering your server(s) for a while.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion: know what HTTP headers you&#8217;re sending</h2>\n<p>While writing this article I was reminded about a tweet quoting <a href="http://www.vanessafox.com/">Vanessa Fox</a> during last weeks SMX West:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>It&#8217;s about more than number of pages crawled &#8211; you need to know about important pages &amp; what response code they return @<a href="https://twitter.com/vanessafox">vanessafox</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23SMX">#SMX</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Ruth Burr (@ruthburr) <a href="https://twitter.com/ruthburr/status/311175630026850304">March 11, 2013</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more and would add to that: <em>at all times</em>.

As Bill Slawski pointed out in the comments, Paul has written articles on SEO <a href="http://boagworld.com/marketing/i-dont-get-seo/">before</a>. Paul, whom I respect tremendously for his web development work, obviously doesn&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; SEO and has evidently had some bad experiences with the snake oil side of our trade over the years. Luckily he&#8217;s shown himself to be willing to learn and I hope to be part of that learning experience. But I also wanted to write about this as I think it&#8217;s important for our industry.</p>\n<p>His main argument, after you remove the link-bait title and the weird introduction, is that what <em>we</em> SEO&#8217;s call SEO these days, shouldn&#8217;t be called SEO as it should be called (decent) web development. I agree in large part with that statement. But here&#8217;s the kicker: if a web developer or web development agency fails (and they do, very often, very miserably), the client often doesn&#8217;t notice. The web developer often delivers a shiny new website with all the bells and whistles that the management asked about. The fact that technically, information structurally and architecturally, the entire site is a mess, will not be noticed by 99% of clients. At least&#8230;</p>\n<p>Not until they notice their analytics, or rather, the fact that their phone stops ringing. And they notice one specific thing: a big hole in their traffic, where organic traffic from search engines used to be. That&#8217;s when they call an SEO, because those are the people that know about search engines, right? That, Paul, is why we&#8217;re still called SEO&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a demand driven thing: the client wants more search traffic, so he / she searches for someone that delivers that to them. They don&#8217;t know that their web developer did a lousy job, it&#8217;s <em>our</em> job to tell that to them.</p>\n<p>In our <a href="http://yoast.com/hire-us/website-review/">website reviews</a> we encounter, on a daily basis, websites that have been redesigned where the web developer / designer deemed it &#8220;not necessary&#8221; to do 301 redirects from the old URL structure to the new one. Where development environments are left open for Google to index and a few wrong links in the content mistakenly go <em>to</em> that development environment, causing havoc for the website in question. Websites where a fancy new faceted based search system causes 4.5 <em>billion</em> URLs (actual example), to be created and Google slowly indexes all of them, leaving the websites ranking in dust. I can go on for hours.</p>\n<p>My buddy <a href="http://theuws.com">Richard</a> commented:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But what if they call it “inbound marketing”?</p></blockquote>\n<p>To which Paul said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I much prefer that. It does not apply that sites should be optimised for search engines over users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sigh. First of all, if SEO means anything, it&#8217;s that we optimize the search engine, not the site. The term is a weird acronym, but people know it now, so we stick with it. You see, even when BMW wants to sell &#8220;mobility&#8221;, in the end they sell cars. We all <em>want</em> to sell website optimization, but in the end, people come to us for SEO. That we&#8217;ll give them website optimization as a result doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>\n<p>Also in the comments, <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/about-seo-by-the-sea/">Bill Slawski</a> said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A person who uses things like keyword density and gateway pages is not an SEO, and never has been.</p>\n<p>But, if you need help with hreflang, canonical link elements, parameter handling, rel prev and next values for pagination, XML sitemaps for pages and images and videos and news, Google Plus authorship markup, Facebook’s Open Graph meta data, schema.org implementation, and many other issues that great content alone will not solve, an SEO can help you with those.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To his credit, Paul <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/11/seo-the-inconvenient-truth/#comment-985658">responded</a> to that thanking Bill and stating that these:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; are not things I would expect any half decent web designers to do as part of their job.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well to be honest Paul, I do expect a decent web designer to know that stuff and if he doesn&#8217;t, I expect him, and thus you, to stop commenting about SEO until you <em>do</em> know about that stuff. You obviously don&#8217;t, because If I take your article from 2010, linked above, as an example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>you haven&#8217;t implemented <a href="http://yoast.com/push-rel-author-head/">rel=&#8221;author&#8221;</a>;</li>\n<li>I can&#8217;t find an XML sitemap;</li>\n<li>most of the pages on his site except for singular posts and pages lack a decent <a href="http://yoast.com/canonical-url-links/">rel=&#8221;canonical&#8221; link element</a>;</li>\n<li>there is no <a href="http://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/">rel=&#8221;prev&#8221; / rel=&#8221;next&#8221;</a> implementation on his archives;</li>\n<li>in fact, there is no decent pagination on those archives at all, and lastly;</li>\n<li>there is no schema.org markup.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I could go on. So, Paul, you say in your article that SEO should be decent web development, but you obviously haven&#8217;t kept up to date with what decent web development is then. I have an easy fix for you though. If you install my (100% free as in beer) <a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/">WordPress SEO plugin</a> and take 2 minutes to configure it, 1 through 4 will be taken care of for you by that plugin, automatically. But if you do that I will take that as an acceptance that there is a very <em>convenient</em> truth about SEO. I trust I&#8217;ll get to convince you that SEO is worth while, but I think the world deserves more than just a comment on your post as a counter argument to your headline, which I know you now regret.</p>\n<p>Let this be the first step in me, and others, convincing you of the value in SEO.

As Bill Slawski pointed out in the comments, Paul has written articles on SEO <a href="http://boagworld.com/marketing/i-dont-get-seo/">before</a>. Paul, whom I respect tremendously for his web development work, obviously doesn&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; SEO and has evidently had some bad experiences with the snake oil side of our trade over the years. Luckily he&#8217;s shown himself to be willing to learn and I hope to be part of that learning experience. But I also wanted to write about this as I think it&#8217;s important for our industry.</p>\n<p>His main argument, after you remove the link-bait title and the weird introduction, is that what <em>we</em> SEO&#8217;s call SEO these days, shouldn&#8217;t be called SEO as it should be called (decent) web development. I agree in large part with that statement. But here&#8217;s the kicker: if a web developer or web development agency fails (and they do, very often, very miserably), the client often doesn&#8217;t notice. The web developer often delivers a shiny new website with all the bells and whistles that the management asked about. The fact that technically, information structurally and architecturally, the entire site is a mess, will not be noticed by 99% of clients. At least&#8230;</p>\n<p>Not until they notice their analytics, or rather, the fact that their phone stops ringing. And they notice one specific thing: a big hole in their traffic, where organic traffic from search engines used to be. That&#8217;s when they call an SEO, because those are the people that know about search engines, right? That, Paul, is why we&#8217;re still called SEO&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a demand driven thing: the client wants more search traffic, so he / she searches for someone that delivers that to them. They don&#8217;t know that their web developer did a lousy job, it&#8217;s <em>our</em> job to tell that to them.</p>\n<p>In our <a href="http://yoast.com/hire-us/website-review/">website reviews</a> we encounter, on a daily basis, websites that have been redesigned where the web developer / designer deemed it &#8220;not necessary&#8221; to do 301 redirects from the old URL structure to the new one. Where development environments are left open for Google to index and a few wrong links in the content mistakenly go <em>to</em> that development environment, causing havoc for the website in question. Websites where a fancy new faceted based search system causes 4.5 <em>billion</em> URLs (actual example), to be created and Google slowly indexes all of them, leaving the websites ranking in dust. I can go on for hours.</p>\n<p>My buddy <a href="http://theuws.com">Richard</a> commented:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But what if they call it “inbound marketing”?</p></blockquote>\n<p>To which Paul said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I much prefer that. It does not apply that sites should be optimised for search engines over users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sigh. First of all, if SEO means anything, it&#8217;s that we optimize the search engine, not the site. The term is a weird acronym, but people know it now, so we stick with it. You see, even when BMW wants to sell &#8220;mobility&#8221;, in the end they sell cars. We all <em>want</em> to sell website optimization, but in the end, people come to us for SEO.

Additional website security checks: DB errors off, file and folder permissions check... \nSystem Info: PHP, MySQL, OS, Server, Memory Usage, IP, SAPI, DNS, Max Upload... Built-in .htaccess file editing, uploading and downloading.</p>\n\n<h4>Login Security &#38; Monitoring Website Security</h4>\n\n<p>Login Security &#38; Login Monitoring: Log All User Account Logins or Log Only User Account Lockouts (see Screenshot). Email alerting options allow you to choose \n5 different email alerting options: Choose to have email alerts sent when a User Account is locked out, An Administrator Logs in, An Administrator \nLogs in and when a User Account is locked out, Any User logs in when a User Account is locked out or Do Not Send Email Alerts.\nSee BulletProof Security Login Security &#38; Monitoring Features for additional features and options.</p>\n\n<h4>Why is .htaccess Website Security So Much Better Than Any Other Type of Website Security?</h4>\n\n<p>The answer is very simple - .htaccess files (distributed configuration files) are processed first before any other code on your website. In other words, \nhackers malicious scripts are stopped by BulletProof Security .htaccess files before those scripts even have a chance to \nreach the php coding in WordPress. BulletProof Security uses .htaccess website security files, which are specific to \nApache Linux Servers. Please read the FAQ page for Server compatibility questions.</p>\n\n<h4>BulletProof Security Fast and Simple with No Manual Configuration Required</h4>\n\n<p>The BulletProof Security WordPress Security plugin is designed to be a fast, simple and one click security plugin to \nadd .htaccess website security protection for your WordPress website. Activate .htaccess website security and .htaccess \nwebsite under maintenance modes from within your WordPress Dashboard - no FTP required. The BulletProof Security \nWordPress plugin is a one click security solution that creates, copies, renames, moves or writes to the provided \nBulletProof Security .htaccess master files. BulletProof Security protects both your Root website folder and wp-admin \nfolder with .htaccess website security protection, as well as providing additional website security protection.</p>\n\n<p>BulletProof Security allows you to add .htaccess website security protection from within the WordPress Dashboard so \nthat you do not have to access your website via FTP or your Web Host Control Panel in order to add website security \nprotection for your WordPress site. BulletProof Security Modes: Root .htaccess security protection, wp-admin .htaccess \nsecurity protection, Deny All .htaccess self protection, WordPress default .htaccess mode and .htaccess Maintenance \nMode (503 Website Under Maintenance). In BulletProof Security Mode your WordPress website is protected from XSS, RFI, \nCRLF, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts.</p>\n\n<h4>BulletProof Security Maintenance Mode</h4>\n\n<p>BulletProof Security Maintenance Mode allows you to create your custom website under maintenance page within BulletProof Security \nand activate Maintenance Mode to put your website in maintenance mode. Maintenance Mode allows website developers or\nwebsite owners to access and work on a website while a 503 Website Under Maintenance page is displayed to\nall other visitors to the website. Allow access to your WordPress Dashboard for only yourself or add additional IP \naddresses to allow mulitple IP addresses access to your WP Dashboard while in maintenance mode.</p>\n\n<h4>BulletProof Security Additional Website Security Protection</h4>\n\n<p>WordPress is already very secure, but every website, no matter what type of platform it is built on should\nhave additional website security measures in place as a standard. BulletProof Security provides that additional website\n security protection that every website should have.</p>\n\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lithuanian by <a href="http://www.Host1Free.com" title="Lithuanian Language Translation by Vincent G from Host1Free.com">Vincent G from Host1Free.com</a></li>\n<li>Filipino/Tagalog by <a href="http://pointen.dk/" title="Filipino/Tagalog Language Translation by pointen.dk">pointen.dk</a></li>\n<li>Russian by EyeFinity</li>\n<li>If you would like to translate the BPS plugin to your language see this <a href="http://www.ait-pro.com/aitpro-blog/4074/wordpress-tips-tricks-fixes/wordpress-plugin-language-translation-tutorial-translating-a-wordpress-plugin-using-poedit/" title="BPS Plugin Language Translation Tutorial" rel="nofollow">BPS Plugin Language Translation Tutorial</a>.

The Master \n.htaccess files are pre-made and BPS writes .htaccess code that is customized for your website. There is nothing to figure out \nor to configure. Click the AutoMagic buttons (creates customized Master .htaccess files) and Activate BulletProof Modes (copies \nthe customized Master .htaccess files to your root and wp-admin folders). BPS has built-in Backup and Restore and \nan .htaccess File Editor for full manual editing control as well. BulletProof Website Security fast and simple. Enjoy!</p>\n\n<h4>How does the BulletProof Security Plugin Login Security &#38; Monitoring work?</h4>\n\n<p>BulletProof Security Login Security &#38; Monitoring allows you to choose whether you want to Log All User Account Logins or \nLog Only User Account Lockouts. The Dynamic DB Logging For has 3 options: Lock, Unlock or Delete database rows. \nThe Login Security database table is hooked into the WordPress Users database table, but they are 2 completely separate \ndatabase tables. If you lock a User Account then BPS Pro will enforce that lock on that User Account and the User will not \nbe able to log in. If you unlock a User Account then the User will be able to login. Deleting database rows in the Login Security \ndatabase table does NOT delete the User Account from the WordPress Users database table. When you delete a User Account it is \npretty much the same thing as unlocking a User Account. To delete actual User Accounts you would go to the WordPress Users page \nand delete that User Account.</p>\n\n<h4>What do I do if my User Account is locked out?</h4>\n\n<p>A stand alone Login Security Unlock User Account Form has been created that allows you to Unlock locked User Accounts outside \nof your WordPress Dashboard. To use this stand alone script download it from this BulletProof Security Pro plugin \nfolder - /wp-content/plugins/bulletproof-security/admin/htaccess/bpsunlock.php and then upload it to your website root folder. \nThen type in the path to the bpsunlock.php file in your Browser. Example: <a href="http://www.example.com/bpsunlock.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/bpsunlock.php</a>. The stand alone \nscript displays step by step instructions on how to use it.</p>\n\n<h4>Do I need to understand .htaccess code in order to use the BulletProof Security Plugin htaccess Core?</h4>\n\n<p>No, The .htaccess file creation is automated in BulletProof Security. Everything is automatically done for you.\nYou do not need to know or understand anything about .htaccess website security files in order to use the \nBulletProof Security plugin. Extensive help information can be found in the Blue Read Me help buttons in BPS.</p>\n\n<h4>What do I do if I cannot log back into my website due to an htaccess file problem?</h4>\n\n<p>If you accidentally activated BulletProof Modes without first clicking the AutoMagic buttons or if you put your \nwebsite in Maintenance Mode and your IP address has been changed by your ISP and you cannot log back into \nyour website then you will need to use FTP or your Web Host Control Panel File Manager and delete the .htaccess file \nthat BPS created in your website root folder. BPS website security is done purely with .htaccess website security\nand nothing else is modified on your website. So simply deleting the .htaccess file in your website root folder\nremoves BPS website security and will allow you to log back in, use the AutoMagic buttons and activate \nBulletProof Mode again to protect your website again.</p>\n\n<h4>Will BulletProof Security cause my website to run slower?</h4>\n\n<p>No, BulletProof Security will not cause a website to run slower. BulletProof Security is website performance optimized \nand uses very little/low website resources and very little Server memory. If you would like to check your plugins to check \nhow much website resource and Server memory each of your plugins is using install the P3 (Plugin Performance Profiler) plugin.\nBoth W3 Total Cache and WP Super Cache use .htaccess code to speed up your website.</p>\n\n<h4>BPS Alert! Your site does not appear to be protected by BulletProof Security. What does the Alert mean?</h4>\n\n<p>When upgrading/updating the BulletProof Security plugin you may see this WP Dashboard Alert. <strong>BPS Alert! Your site does not \nappear to be protected by BulletProof Security.</strong> There are 2 very common issues/problems that can cause this. The cPanel \nHotLink Protection Tool issue or the WordPress flush_rewrite_rules function issue. Click this link <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/bps-setup-steps-removal-steps-requirements-and-compatibility/" title="BulletProof Security Forum">Common BPS Issues</a> \nNote: Any custom htaccess code or modifications that you have made to your htaccess files will not be altered, modified or changed \nduring the auto-update. Activating BulletProof Modes again after upgrading BPS is no longer necessary.</p>\n\n<h4>Where can I find BulletProof Security additional troubleshooting steps &#38; support?</h4>\n\n<p>Please see the <a href="http://forum.ait-pro.com/forums/forum/bulletproof-security-free/" title="BulletProof Security Forum" rel="nofollow">BulletProof Security Forum.</a></p>\n\n<h4>BulletProof Security Server Compatibilty</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Compatible with Apache CGI configured Servers</li>\n<li>Compatible with Apache DSO configured Servers (May require file/folder permission and/or Ownership changes)</li>\n<li>Compatible with Nginx frontend Server with Apache backend Server</li>\n<li>Compatible with LiteSpeed Servers</li>\n<li>Compatible with Windows IIS Servers - Windows Hosting - See IMPORTANT NOTES below.</li>\n<li>If your IIS Server has ISAPI_Rewrite installed then you CAN use .htaccess files / BulletProof Modes.</li>\n<li><strong>IMPORTANT NOTES:</strong> If you have an IIS Server you may or may not be able to use .htaccess files and can only use Login Security &#38; Monitoring. \nIf your IIS Server is using the URL Rewrite Module then you can probably use .htaccess files / BulletProof Modes. If you activate \nBulletProof Modes and your website crashes then FTP to your website and delete the root .htaccess file and the wp-admin .htaccess file. You \nwill not be able to use .htaccess files on your Server/website and can only use Login Security and the other features in BPS.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Additional BulletProof Security Server Compatibilty Info</h4>\n\n<p>BulletProof Security uses .htaccess website security files, which are specific to Apache Linux Servers. BPS is compatible with Apache Linux Servers, \nLiteSpeed Servers, Nginx Servers (if the Nginx Server is the frontend Server and Apache Linux Server is the backend Server). If you do not know what type of Server \nyou have you can check your Server Type and Operating System on the BPS System Info page. You can install BulletProof Security if you have a Windows IIS\nhosted website to use the additional features in BPS, but may or may not be able to Activate BulletProof Modes depending on what your IIS Server does and \ndoes not have installed / configured. Please see this WordPress Codex <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#Permalinks_without_mod_rewrite" title="Permalinks without mod_rewrite">Permalinks without mod_rewrite</a> for additional information regarding IIS Servers and also the Helicon Tech website <a href="http://www.isapirewrite.com/" title="Helicon Tech ISAPI_Rewrite"> for additional information regarding ISAPI_Rewrite.</a></p>\n\n<h4>Does BulletProof Security Work on ALL Nginx Servers / Server Configurations?</h4>\n\n<p>If you are using both Apache and Nginx together and Nginx is the frontend webserver and Apache is the backend Server\nused to process PHP then BulletProof Security will work on this type of combined Server Configuration. If you are only\nusing Nginx then an .htaccess file will not work. Nginx has its own rewrite module - HttpRewriteModule and the mod_rewrite equivalent\nof an .htaccess file has similar, but different coding and is added to an Nginx Server config file.\nNote: If you are not familiar with Nginx, then it should be noted that Nginx does not have a PHP module like Apache''s mod_php, \ninstead you either need to build PHP with FPM (ie: php-fpm/fastcgi), or you need to pass the request to something that can handle PHP.</p>\n\n<h4>Are there any known issues or conflicts with other WordPress Plugins or Themes?</h4>\n\n<p>Occasionally issues or conflicts do occur with other plugins, but they are always quickly resolved. BPS is compatible with all\nother Plugins and Themes. An .htaccess bypass / skip rule is all that is required to allow a plugin or theme to do something that is blocked by BPS.\nPlease check the BulletProof Security <a href="http://www.ait-pro.com/aitpro-blog/2252/bulletproof-security-plugin-support/checking-plugin-compatibility-with-bps-plugin-testing-to-do-list/" title="BPS Plugin Testing and Fixes" rel="nofollow">Plugin Compatibility Testing and Fixes</a> page for the latest plugin bypass / skip rules. All new plugin skip / bypass \nrules are now being posted in the <a href="http://forum.ait-pro.com/" title="BPS Forum" rel="nofollow">BulletProof Security Forum</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>I am seeing Security Log entries in my BulletProof Security Log. What do they mean?</h4>\n\n<p>Your Security Log will log 400, 403 and 404 (requires copying the BPS 404 logging code to your Theme''s 404.php Template) Errors. \nThe Security Log logs 400 and 403 HTTP Response Status Codes by default. You can also log 404 HTTP Response Status Codes by opening this BPS \n404 Template file - /bulletproof-security/404.php and copying the logging code into your Theme''s 404 Template file. When you open the BPS Pro \n404.php file you will see simple instructions on how to add the 404 logging code to your Theme''s 404 Template file.</p>\n\n<h4>HTTP Response Status Codes</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>400 Bad Request - The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.</li>\n<li>403 Forbidden - The Server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.</li>\n<li>404 Not Found - The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI / URL. No indication is given to whether the condition is temporary or permanent.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>What is the difference between BulletProof Security free and BulletProof Security Pro?</h4>\n\n<h4>BulletProof Security</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>.htaccess Website Security Protection</li>\n<li>Security Logging</li>\n<li>HTTP Error Logging</li>\n<li>Login Security &#38; Monitoring</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>BulletProof Security Pro Feature Highlights</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>AutoRestore - Automatic File Restore</li>\n<li>Quarantine - Automatic File Quarantine</li>\n<li>Real-time File Monitor (ARQ Infinity)</li>\n<li>Plugin Firewall (true IP Based Firewall)</li>\n<li>Uploads Folder Anti-Exploit Guard</li>\n<li>.htaccess Website Security</li>\n<li>Custom php.ini Website Security</li>\n<li>Login Security &#38; Monitoring w/Dashboard Alerting / Status Display &#38; additional options/features</li>\n<li>F-Lock - Read Only File Locking</li>\n<li>Security Logging</li>\n<li>HTTP Error Logging</li>\n<li>PHP Error Logging</li>\n<li>Email Alerts</li>\n<li>Versatile Set of Pro-Tools...</li>\n<li>Base64 Decoder / Encoder...</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.ait-pro.com/aitpro-blog/3395/bulletproof-security-pro/bps-free-vs-bps-pro-feature-comparison/" title="BulletProof Security Features" rel="nofollow">View All BulletProof Security Pro Feature Details</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Is BulletProof Security Network / Multisite Compatible?</h4>\n\n<p>Yes. BulletProof Security contains AutoMagic buttons for Network / Multisite websites. Both sub-directory and sub-domain Master .htaccess \ncode is written / created for your specific Network / Multisite site. BulletProof Modes should ONLY be Activated on the Primary site to automatically \nprotect all sub sites. Sub sites are virtual. DO NOT Activate BulletProof Modes on sub sites. BPS allows only Super Admins to see the BPS menus \nin sub sites. BulletProof Security also works with Network / Multisite Domain Mapping.</p>\n\n<h4>Is BulletProof Security BuddyPress Compatible?</h4>\n\n<p>Yes. BulletProof Security works with all BuddyPress site types.</p>\n\n<h4>Is BulletProof Security Compatible with subdomain websites and subdirectory websites?</h4>\n\n<p>Yes, BulletProof Security works on all types of WordPress installations including "Giving WordPress Its Own Directory" websites.</p>\n\n<h4>Is BulletProof Security automatically setup already?</h4>\n\n<p>Yes and No. You must be using a WordPress Custom Permalink structure for BPS to work correctly (every WordPress site should be anyway). If \nyou are not using a custom Permalink structure then you will get a warning message that Custom Permalinks need to be enabled when you access \nthe BulletProof Security Options page. BulletProof Security includes AutoMagic Master .htaccess file creation so that only one click is \nrequired to automatically create your Master .htaccess security files for your website, which you then Activate - BulletProof Mode. \nBulletProof Security also offers full manual control of editing the .htaccess files using the built-in File Editor. BulletProof Security is \ndesigned with everyone in mind: regular folks, Designers, Developers and Coders. BulletProof Security is designed to work with every type \nof WordPress installation: Single websites, subfolder websites, subdomain websites, "Giving WordPress its Own Directory" websites, \nNetwork / Multisite subdirectory websites and Network / Multisite subdomain websites. BulletProof Security will automatically create the correct Master \n.htaccess files for your website when you click the AutoMagic buttons. If you prefer to do everything manually then you would edit your \n.htaccess using the built-in .htaccess File Editor instead of using Automagic to automatically create your .htaccess files.</p>\n\n<h4>Can I add my own .htaccess code to the BulletProof Security .htaccess files?</h4>\n\n<p>Yes. Of course. The secure.htaccess and wpadmin-secure.htaccess Master .htaccess files already contain .htaccess security code that protects \nyour website against XSS, RFI, CRLF, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts. Add any additional security filters or \nother .htaccess code to your Master .htaccess files or your currently active .htaccess files using the built-in .htaccess File Editor. The \nBulletProof Security Master .htaccess files contain help info and additional options within the .htaccess files themselves. htaccess files \ncan do a lot of neat things besides just providing website security protection. As of version .46.9 you can now also add any custom code \nto the Custom Code feature. Your custom .htaccess code will be saved to your WP DB permanently until you delete it. Please view the Read Me \nHelp button in Custom Code for specific details.</p>\n\n<h4>Does the BulletProof Security Plugin create or write the .htaccess files?</h4>\n\n<p>Yes, BulletProof Security creates customized .htaccess website security files with AutoMagic. BulletProof Security also offers full manual \ncontrol of editing both the BPS Master .htaccess files and your currently active .htaccess files using the built-in .htaccess File Editor. \nThe BPS Master .htaccess files have already been pre-made. When you click the AutoMagic buttons your .htaccess Master files are created with \nspecific code for your specific website with the correct RewriteRule and RewriteBase automatically added to your .htaccess files. You can \nadd additional code to the master .htaccess files, edit the .htaccess files or create completely new .htaccess master files from within the \nWordPress Dashboard using the built-in BPS File Editor - no FTP required - no Web Host Control Panel required.  BPS could also just be used \nsimply as an online .htaccess file editor and manager. AutoMagic is great, but having both AutoMagic and full manual editing control makes \nBulletProof Security a very versatile website security protection tool.</p>\n\n<h4>Does BulletProof Security work with Git distributed version control system?</h4>\n\n<p>Yes, BulletProof Security works with Git, but does require some additional set up steps. Please see this thread for the setup steps\n <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-bulletproof-security-bps-and-folder-locations?replies=15#post-2979555" title="BPS Plugin Language Translation Tutorial" rel="nofollow">Git distributed version control system setup steps</a></p>";s:11:"other_notes";s:1617:"<h3>Help Info</h3>\n<p>Extensive Help Info can be found on the AIT-pro.com website and within the BulletProof \n Security pages themselves. Click on the blue Read Me Help buttons to get Help Info about\nthe particular section or page of the BulletProof Security plugin that you are in.

Content management systems provide business users with rapid access to the information and services they need to help them do their jobs more efficiently, make better-informed business decisions and enable their organizations to become smarter, thus more competitive.\r\n\r\nAccenture offers comprehensive solutions for all aspects of content management, including document management, Web content management, digital asset management, records management, imaging and enterprise content integration.\r\n\r\nAccenture''s content management services can effectively help your enterprise optimize the value of its information at a lower total cost at every point in the information lifecycle.\r\n\r\nContent management practices and goals vary by mission and by organizational governance structure. News organizations, <a title="E-commerce" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce">e-commerce</a> websites, and educational institutions all use content management, but in different ways. This leads to differences in terminology and in the names and number of steps in the process.\r\n\r\nFor example, some digital content is created by one or more authors. Over time that content may be edited. One or more individuals may provide some editorial oversight, approving the content for publication. Publishing may take many forms: it may be the act of "pushing" content out to others, or simply granting digital access rights to certain content to one or more individuals. Later that content may be superseded by another version of the content and thus retired or removed from use (as when this wiki page is modified).\r\n\r\nContent management is an inherently collaborative process. It often consists of the following basic roles and responsibilities:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Creator - responsible for creating and editing content.</li>\r\n	<li>Editor - responsible for tuning the content message and the style of delivery, including translation and localization.</li>\r\n	<li>Publisher - responsible for releasing the content for use.</li>\r\n	<li>Administrator - responsible for managing access permissions to folders and files, usually accomplished by assigning access rights to user groups or roles. Admins may also assist and support users in various ways.</li>\r\n	<li>Consumer, viewer or guest- the person who reads or otherwise takes in content after it is published or shared.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nA critical aspect of content management is the ability to manage versions of content as it evolves (<i>see also</i> <a title="Version control" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control</a>).

Content can be simple text, photos, music, video, documents, or just about anything you can think of. A major advantage of using a CMS is that it requires almost no technical skill or knowledge to manage. Since the CMS manages all your content, you don''t have to.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are some real world examples of what Joomla! can do?</strong>\r\n\r\nJoomla is used all over the world to power Web sites of all shapes and sizes.

Since then it has grown to be the largest self-hosted blogging tool in the world, used on millions of sites and seen by tens of millions of people every day.\r\n\r\nEverything you see here, from the documentation to the code itself, was created <strong>by and for the community</strong>. WordPress is an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> project, which means there are hundreds of people all over the world working on it. (More than most commercial platforms.) It also means you are free to use it for anything from your <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/">cat’s home page</a> to a <a href="http://wordpress.org/showcase/tag/fortune-500/">Fortune 500 web site</a> without paying anyone a license fee <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">and a number of other important freedoms</a>.\r\n<h3>About WordPress.org</h3>\r\nOn this site you can download and install a software script called WordPress. To do this you need a <a href="http://wordpress.org/hosting/">web host</a> who meets the <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/">minimum requirements</a> and a little time.

Content management systems provide business users with rapid access to the information and services they need to help them do their jobs more efficiently, make better-informed business decisions and enable their organizations to become smarter, thus more competitive.\r\n\r\nAccenture offers comprehensive solutions for all aspects of content management, including document management, Web content management, digital asset management, records management, imaging and enterprise content integration.\r\n\r\nAccenture''s content management services can effectively help your enterprise optimize the value of its information at a lower total cost at every point in the information lifecycle.\r\n\r\nContent management practices and goals vary by mission and by organizational governance structure. News organizations, <a title="E-commerce" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce">e-commerce</a> websites, and educational institutions all use content management, but in different ways. This leads to differences in terminology and in the names and number of steps in the process.\r\n\r\nFor example, some digital content is created by one or more authors. Over time that content may be edited. One or more individuals may provide some editorial oversight, approving the content for publication. Publishing may take many forms: it may be the act of "pushing" content out to others, or simply granting digital access rights to certain content to one or more individuals. Later that content may be superseded by another version of the content and thus retired or removed from use (as when this wiki page is modified).\r\n\r\nContent management is an inherently collaborative process. It often consists of the following basic roles and responsibilities:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Creator - responsible for creating and editing content.</li>\r\n	<li>Editor - responsible for tuning the content message and the style of delivery, including translation and localization.</li>\r\n	<li>Publisher - responsible for releasing the content for use.</li>\r\n	<li>Administrator - responsible for managing access permissions to folders and files, usually accomplished by assigning access rights to user groups or roles. Admins may also assist and support users in various ways.</li>\r\n	<li>Consumer, viewer or guest- the person who reads or otherwise takes in content after it is published or shared.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nA critical aspect of content management is the ability to manage versions of content as it evolves (<i>see also</i> <a title="Version control" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control</a>).

Best of all, Joomla is an open source solution that is freely available to everyone.\r\n\r\n<strong>What''s a content management system (CMS)?</strong>\r\n\r\nA content management system is software that keeps track of every piece of content on your Web site, much like your local public library keeps track of books and stores them. Content can be simple text, photos, music, video, documents, or just about anything you can think of. A major advantage of using a CMS is that it requires almost no technical skill or knowledge to manage. Since the CMS manages all your content, you don''t have to.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are some real world examples of what Joomla! can do?</strong>\r\n\r\nJoomla is used all over the world to power Web sites of all shapes and sizes. For example:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Corporate Web sites or portals</li>\r\n	<li>Corporate intranets and extranets</li>\r\n	<li>Online magazines, newspapers, and publications</li>\r\n	<li>E-commerce and online reservations</li>\r\n	<li>Government applications</li>\r\n	<li>Small business Web sites</li>\r\n	<li>Non-profit and organizational Web sites</li>\r\n	<li>Community-based portals</li>\r\n	<li>School and church Web sites</li>\r\n	<li>Personal or family homepages</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Who uses Joomla?</strong>\r\n\r\nHere are just a few examples of Web sites that use Joomla:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>MTV Networks Quizilla (Social networking) - http://www.quizilla.com</li>\r\n	<li>IHOP (Restaurant chain) - http://www.ihop.com</li>\r\n	<li>Harvard University (Educational) - http://gsas.harvard.edu</li>\r\n	<li>Citibank (Financial institution intranet) - Not publicly accessible</li>\r\n	<li>The Green Maven (Eco-resources) - http://www.greenmaven.com</li>\r\n	<li>Outdoor Photographer (Magazine) - http://www.outdoorphotographer.com</li>\r\n	<li>PlayShakespeare.com (Cultural) - http://www.playshakespeare.com</li>\r\n	<li>Senso Interiors (Furniture design) - http://www.sensointeriors.co.za</li>\r\n</ul>', 'Joomla Development', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '59-revision-6', '', '', '2013-07-02 09:50:56', '2013-07-02 09:50:56', '', 59, 'http://www.pleasuresolutions.com/uncategorized/59-revision-6/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
